Sistem ini menyediakan 'Question Library' yang mencakup topik Manajemen Waktu, Penggajian (Payroll), dan data Karyawan, seperti tren ketidakhadiran atau simulasi Take Home Pay (THP). Dalam simulasi THP, pengguna cukup memasukkan nominal THP yang diinginkan dan sistem akan menghitungnya secara otomatis, termasuk penyesuaian detail konfigurasi pajak dan BPJS jika diperlukan. Selain memberikan jawaban teks, sistem menghasilkan visualisasi data berupa bagan dan grafik serta laporan yang dapat diunduh dalam format .xlsx. Dari aspek keamanan, data pengguna diproses secara aman tanpa retensi di luar sesi, jawaban dienkripsi, informasi PII dianonimkan, dan perintah pengguna (prompt) tidak digunakan untuk melatih model GPT. Akses terhadap fitur dan data ini juga dibatasi secara ketat oleh sistem 'menu trustee' dan 'data trustee'.","[""152561-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-12"", ""152561-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-13"", ""152561-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-14"", ""152561-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-18"", ""152561-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-23"", ""152561-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-24"", ""152561-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-25"", ""152561-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-47"", ""152561-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-48""]","Functional Requirements

        b)        Secara otomatis generate tanggal bukti potong pajak sesuai dengan tanggal unduh jika dan hanya jika tanggal unduh < EOM dari bulan berakhir pajak

                i)        Jika user mengunduh bukti potong pajak 1721 A1 karyawan yang bulan berakhir pajaknya = November 2022 & tanggal pembayaran = 24 Nov 2022 & tanggal diunduh = 26 November 2022 , maka tanggal bukti potong pajak = 26 Nov 2022

        c)        Secara otomatis generate tanggal bukti potong pajak sesuai dengan tanggal pembayaran terakhir di bulan berakhir pajak

                i)        Jika user mengunduh bukti potong pajak 1721 A1 karyawan yang bulan berakhir pajaknya = November 2022 & tanggal pembayaran = 24 Nov 2022 & tanggal diunduh = 26 November 2022 , maka tanggal bukti potong pajak = 24 Nov 2022

                ii)        Jika user menggunakan migrasi pajak tahunan ataupun bulanan

                        1)        Field tanggal pembayaran akan kosong

                        2)        Sehingga, tanggal bukti potong pajak akan tetap mengikuti end period.

29,Apa perbedaan mekanisme perhitungan pajak Netto dan Gross Up pada versi terbaru CATAPA?,"Pada metode Netto, pajak dibayarkan oleh perusahaan sebagai subsidi dalam bentuk Income non-THP (menggunakan komponen B15 - Pajak Dibayar Perusahaan), sehingga tidak mempengaruhi nilai THP karyawan.

Sementara itu, pada metode Gross Up, pajak ditunjang perusahaan dalam bentuk Tunj. Pajak yang dihitung sebagai penambah penghasilan bruto dan muncul sebagai Income THP (B03) serta Deduction THP (D09). Jika karyawan Netto tidak memiliki NPWP, denda dapat ditanggung perusahaan melalui item B17 (Income non-THP) atau ditanggung karyawan melalui D11 (Deduction THP).","[""153175-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-7"", ""153175-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-8"", ""153175-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-9"", ""153175-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-14""]","Salary Item for Tax Method

3)        Pada metode pajak Netto dan Gross up, komponen gaji pada salary process akan menggunakan komponen gaji yang sama, tetapi terdapat perbedaan di perhitungan pajaknya

        a)        Gross up: nilai dari Tunj. Pajak merupakan objek pajak yang menjadi penambah penghasilan bruto karyawan

        b)        Netto: nilai dari Tunj. Pajak bukan merupakan objek pajak

Solution
1)        Perlu menambahkan komponen gaji baru untuk metode pajak netto

        a)        Sebelumnya komponen gaji Tunj. Pajak dan Pajak akan diisi dengan nilai yang sama sehingga secara total tidak berpengaruh ke THP karyawan

        b)        Diubah dengan komponen gaji Income Non THP: B15 - Pajak Dibayar Perusahaan

                i)        Nilai B03 Tunj. Pajak dan D09 Pajak tidak akan diisi untuk metode pajak netto

2)        Jika karyawan tidak memiliki NPWP, terdapat dua opsi apakah denda NPWP akan dibayarkan oleh perusahaan atau karyawan

        a)        Denda dibayar karyawan

                i)        Nilai dari denda NPWP akan mengisi komponen gaji D11 - Denda Non NPWP (deduction THP) sama seperti mekanisme sebelumnya

                ii)        Sehingga nantinya akan ada

                        1)        B15 - Pajak Dibayar Perusahaan (income non THP); dan

                        2)        D11 - Denda Non NPWP (deduction THP)

        b)        Denda dibayar perusahaan

                i)        Perlu menambahkan komponen gaji baru untuk denda Non NPWP ditanggung perusahaan

                ii)        Income Non THP: B17 - Denda Non NPWP Dibayar Perusahaan

                iii)        Sehingga nantinya akan ada

                        1)        B15 - Pajak Dibayar Perusahaan (income non THP); dan

                        2)        B17 - Denda Non NPWP Dibayar Perusahaan (income non THP)

3)        Regular Salary Process/Transition Process/Retroactive Process

        a)        Menambahkan salary type baru ke setiap salary template

                i)        B15 - Pajak Dibayar Perusahaan (income non THP)

                ii)        B17 - Denda Non NPWP Dibayar Perusahaan (income non THP)

        b)        Tidak perlu untuk melakukan migrasi data sebelumnya

                i)        Reason: metode Netto ini sudah berubah beberapa kali dan tidak dilakukan proses migrasi sebelumnya, sehingga jika dilakukan migrasi akan cukup sulit dilakukan

                ii)        CCS ack bahwa akan terdapat perubahan secara laporan ataupun tampilan payslip setelah ini diimplementasikan.

4)        Additional Income / Former Employee Income

4)        Additional Income / Former Employee Income

        a)        Menambahkan row baru di tabel pajak:

                i)        Pajak Dibayar Perusahaan (Tax Paid By Company)

                ii)        Denda Non NPWP DItanggung Perusahaan (Tax Fine Non NPWP Paid By Company)

5)        Inkonsistensi

        a)        Terdapat perbedaan cara menampilkan pajak di Additional Income dam Former Employee Income

        b)        Perlu ada perubahan atas FE agar tampilan pajak konsisten di menu Additional Income dan Former Employee Income.

        c)        Perlu ada perubahan atas FE atas Severance

6)        Perlu adanya pengecekan dari extension saat ini

        a)        Tiket: tidak mengambil item pajak di extension

        b)        BCA Magma: tidak menggunakan netto

        c)        BCA Digital: tidak menggunakan netto

        d)        Custom page: tidak menggunakan netto

        e)        BCAS: tidak menggunakan netto

7)        Karena adanya kemungkinan tenant yang tidak menginginkan perubahan atas mekanisme CATAPA saat ini, maka:

        a)        Perlu ada pembuatan policy apakah metode Netto menggunakan mekanisme CATAPA lama (income/deduction THP) atau mekanisme baru (income non THP)

Objective
1)        Menyediakan fleksibilitas bagi tenant untuk menampilkan pajak dibayar perusahaan (metode pajak Netto) di payslip dan payroll report

        a)        Opsi 1: THP

                ii)        B177- Denda Non NPWP Dibayar Perusahaan (income non THP)

2)        Dapat membedakan komponen gaji yang digunakan untuk Gross up dan Netto

        a)        Gross up: pajak ditunjang perusahaan

        b)        Netto: pajak ditanggung perusahaan

Current Implementation
1)        Saat ini di CATAPA terdapat komponen gaji yang digunakan untuk perhitungan pajak:

        a)        B03 - Tunj. Pajak (income THP)

        b)        D09 - Pajak (deduction THP)

        c)        D11 - Denda Non NPWP (deduction THP)

2)        Komponen gaji di atas, digunakan pada semua metode pajak yang ada di CATAPA: Gross, Netto, Gross up, dan Kombinasi Gross dan Gross up

3)        Pada metode pajak Netto dan Gross up, komponen gaji pada salary process akan menggunakan komponen gaji yang sama, tetapi terdapat perbedaan di perhitungan pajaknya

        a)        Gross up: nilai dari Tunj. Pajak merupakan objek pajak yang menjadi penambah penghasilan bruto karyawan

        b)        Netto: nilai dari Tunj. Pajak bukan merupakan objek pajak

30,Bagaimana mekanisme penghapusan Effective-Date Monotonicity dan penerapan Post-Payroll Validation yang baru menjaga fleksibilitas tanpa merusak integritas data historis?,"Sistem akan menghapus aturan Effective-Date Monotonicity, sehingga pengguna dapat memasukkan record dengan tanggal efektif apa pun, termasuk yang lebih awal dari entry yang sudah ada. Untuk menjaga integritas, Post-Payroll Validation kini dapat dikonfigurasi (configurable) per kategori data, di mana admin dapat memilih status Block, Warning, atau Allow untuk pengeditan setelah payroll diproses. Integritas historis tetap terjaga melalui mekanisme snapshot yang menangkap nilai penggajian saat diproses, di mana field snapshot kini merujuk pada nilai langsung (value) daripada Foreign Key ID agar tetap traceable jika master data berubah. Selain itu, master data yang sudah masuk dalam snapshot akan dilarang untuk dihapus secara permanen guna mempertahankan audit trail. Setiap perubahan pada field kritikal seperti data pekerjaan, pajak, dan gaji akan dicatat secara komprehensif dalam log audit.","[""153160-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-5"", ""153160-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-12"", ""153160-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-13"", ""153160-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-17"", ""153160-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-18"", ""153160-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-19""]","Custom Payslip

Custom Payslip
Background
1)	Terdapat kebutuhan yang berbeda-beda terkait format payslip karyawan antar perusahaan:

	a)	Informasi data perusahaan yang ditampilkan

	b)	Informasi data karyawan yang ditampilkan

	c)	Informasi data penghasilan yang ditampilkan

	d)	Informasi lainnya yang ingin ditambahkan di payslip

2)	Format payslip dapat berbeda-beda untuk setiap kelompok karyawan tertentu

3)	Payslip dapat digunakan sebagai bukti penggajian ke karyawan dan sebagai audit bagi HR

	a)	Oleh sebab ini, detail payslip yang dibutuhkan oleh HR dapat berbeda dengan yang seharusnya dikirimkan ke karyawan.

4)	Saat ini CATAPA hanya dapat membuat payslip yang formatnya sudah ditentukan dari awal.

	a)	Hanya beberapa field yang dapat dikustomisasi:

		i)	Apakah akan memunculkan item Non THP atau tidak (hanya untuk unduhan dari aplikasi CATAPA)

		ii)	Apakah akan memunculkan item dengan nilai 0 atau tidak (hanya untuk unduhan dari aplikasi CATAPA)

Objective
1)	CATAPA dapat mensupport format payslip yang dikustomisasi sesuai kebutuhan perusahaan untuk kelompok karyawan tertentu:

	a)	Dapat memberikan kebebasan kepada pengguna untuk memilih data perusahaan yang ingin ditampilkan

	b)	Dapat memberikan kebebasan kepada pengguna untuk memilih data karyawan yang ingin ditampilkan

	c)	Dapat memberikan kebebasan kepada pengguna untuk memilih informasi penggajian yang ingin ditampilkan

	d)	Dapat memberikan kebebasan kepada pengguna untuk menambahkan informasi lainnya yang mendukung penggajian.

	a)	Header:

		i)	Logo CATAPA

		ii)	Nama Perusahaan

		iii)	Alamat

		iv)	Logo Perusahaan

	b)	Data Karyawan:

Objective
To provide a more flexible yet controlled approach, the system will:

--	Remove Effective-Date Monotonicity: Users will be allowed to enter or update records using any effective date, including ones that are the same as or earlier than existing entries. No restrictions will be applied at the system level.

--	Make Post-Payroll Validation Configurable: Admins can define whether certain data categories remain editable after payroll has been processed. For example, changes may be:

	--	Fully blocked (current behavior)

	--	Allowed with warnings

	--	Allowed unconditionally

--	Preserve payroll history using snapshotting and other mechanisms, even if retroactive changes occur.

--	Support auditing and retro-pay indicators for transparency into post-payroll or backdated changes.

Current Implementation
Currently, the system enforces two validations on employee data:

1)	Post-Payroll Validation:
 After payroll is processed, users cannot edit:

	--	Employment Data

	--	Tax Membership

	--	BPJS KS Membership

	--	BPJS TK Membership

	--	Payment Method

	--	Employee Paygroup

	--	Salary Changes

	--	Pre Process Editable
 This is to prevent changes that could invalidate payroll computations.

2)	Effective-Date Monotonicity:
Regardless of payroll status, a user cannot create or update a record using an Effective Date that is equal to or earlier than the latest existing record's date.

###

Backdated Data Changes for Payroll-Related Data
Solutions
Remove and Reconfigure Validations

To maintain historical integrity even with relaxed validations:

--	Non-blocking Warnings
Retroactive changes affecting processed payroll periods will trigger visible warnings but not prevent updates.

--	Historical Snapshot Preservation
 Snapshots will continue capturing payroll-relevant values at the time of processing:

	--	Value over ID: Where possible, snapshot fields will store actual values (e.g., paygroup name or salary amount) instead of foreign keys/IDs.

	--	Soft-Deletion for Master Data: If a record is used in a snapshot, the system will prevent hard deletion. Instead, the record will be archived to retain audit history.

--	Audit Logging
 All retroactive or archived changes will be logged, ensuring traceability.

Additional Agreed Behaviors:

--	Snapshot fields that previously referred to IDs will now reference values directly where applicable.

--	For data types like Salary Changes and Paygroup, snapshot reference will be changed to capture value instead of ID.

--	For Tax Membership, BPJS KS, and BPJS TK, a refactor is needed before enabling snapshot-to-value capture.

--	For Employment Data, Payment Method, and Termination Data, validation rules will be lifted immediately without requiring backend changes.

--	Once an ID has been used in a snapshot, the referenced master data cannot be deleted—delete actions will be disabled.

Design Justification
This solution is preferred for the following reasons:

Backdated Data Changes for Payroll-Related Data
Solutions

Removal of Effective Date Monotonicity
Background
--	Currently, the system enforces Effective Date Monotonicity, where new records can only be added if the effective date is later than the latest existing record.

--	Payroll now has a snapshot mechanism that ensures data validity at the time of payroll processing, independent of monotonicity.

--	Users require the ability to make backdated changes, including:

	--	Adding new records before existing effective dates,

	--	Modifying existing effective dates,

	--	Overriding existing records,

	--	Deleting past records.

--	The original system design did not anticipate backdated insertions or overrides for continuous and non-overlapping data types, due to risks of impacting other modules (Time Management and Benefit Management) which were designed with the assumption of monotonicity.

Scope
This requirement applies to effective-dated data relevant for payroll:

1)	Salary Changes

2)	Paygroup

3)	Payment Method

4)	BPJS TK Membership

5)	BPJS KS Membership

6)	Tax Membership

Phased Approach:

--	Phase 1 (Low Impact): BPJS TK, BPJS KS, Tax Membership (used only in Payroll).

--	Phase 2 (High Impact): Salary Changes, Paygroup, Payment Method (also used by Time Management and Benefit Management).","Backdated Data Changes for Payroll-Related Data

Objective
To provide a more flexible yet controlled approach, the system will:

--	Remove Effective-Date Monotonicity: Users will be allowed to enter or update records using any effective date, including ones that are the same as or earlier than existing entries. No restrictions will be applied at the system level.

--	Make Post-Payroll Validation Configurable: Admins can define whether certain data categories remain editable after payroll has been processed. For example, changes may be:

	--	Fully blocked (current behavior)

	--	Allowed with warnings

	--	Allowed unconditionally

--	Preserve payroll history using snapshotting and other mechanisms, even if retroactive changes occur.

--	Support auditing and retro-pay indicators for transparency into post-payroll or backdated changes.

Current Implementation
Currently, the system enforces two validations on employee data:

1)	Post-Payroll Validation:
 After payroll is processed, users cannot edit:

	--	Employment Data

	--	Tax Membership

	--	BPJS KS Membership

	--	BPJS TK Membership

	--	Payment Method

	--	Employee Paygroup

	--	Salary Changes

	--	Pre Process Editable
 This is to prevent changes that could invalidate payroll computations.

2)	Effective-Date Monotonicity:
Regardless of payroll status, a user cannot create or update a record using an Effective Date that is equal to or earlier than the latest existing record's date.

To maintain historical integrity even with relaxed validations:

--	Non-blocking Warnings
Retroactive changes affecting processed payroll periods will trigger visible warnings but not prevent updates.

--	Historical Snapshot Preservation
 Snapshots will continue capturing payroll-relevant values at the time of processing:

	--	Value over ID: Where possible, snapshot fields will store actual values (e.g., paygroup name or salary amount) instead of foreign keys/IDs.

	--	Soft-Deletion for Master Data: If a record is used in a snapshot, the system will prevent hard deletion. Instead, the record will be archived to retain audit history.

--	Audit Logging
 All retroactive or archived changes will be logged, ensuring traceability.

Additional Agreed Behaviors:

--	Snapshot fields that previously referred to IDs will now reference values directly where applicable.

--	For data types like Salary Changes and Paygroup, snapshot reference will be changed to capture value instead of ID.

--	For Tax Membership, BPJS KS, and BPJS TK, a refactor is needed before enabling snapshot-to-value capture.

--	For Employment Data, Payment Method, and Termination Data, validation rules will be lifted immediately without requiring backend changes.

--	Once an ID has been used in a snapshot, the referenced master data cannot be deleted—delete actions will be disabled.

Backdated Data Changes for Payroll-Related Data
Solutions

Removal of Effective Date Monotonicity
Background
--	Currently, the system enforces Effective Date Monotonicity, where new records can only be added if the effective date is later than the latest existing record.

--	Payroll now has a snapshot mechanism that ensures data validity at the time of payroll processing, independent of monotonicity.

--	Users require the ability to make backdated changes, including:

	--	Adding new records before existing effective dates,

	--	Modifying existing effective dates,

	--	Overriding existing records,

	--	Deleting past records.

--	The original system design did not anticipate backdated insertions or overrides for continuous and non-overlapping data types, due to risks of impacting other modules (Time Management and Benefit Management) which were designed with the assumption of monotonicity.

Scope
This requirement applies to effective-dated data relevant for payroll:

1)	Salary Changes

2)	Paygroup

3)	Payment Method

4)	BPJS TK Membership

5)	BPJS KS Membership

6)	Tax Membership

Phased Approach:

--	Phase 1 (Low Impact): BPJS TK, BPJS KS, Tax Membership (used only in Payroll).

--	Phase 2 (High Impact): Salary Changes, Paygroup, Payment Method (also used by Time Management and Benefit Management).","catapa_source_14, catapa_source_14, catapa_source_14, catapa_source_14, catapa_source_14, catapa_source_14, catapa_source_14","catapa_source_14, catapa_source_14, catapa_source_14, catapa_source_14, catapa_source_14, catapa_source_14, catapa_source_14",7,

Background
As of October 2024, the Indonesian government will enforce the Undang-Undang Perlindungan Data Pribadi (UU PDP). This regulation requires websites to obtain explicit consent from users regarding the use of cookies that track personal data.

To comply with this, CATAPA’s landing page (catapa.com) needs to implement a cookie consent feature. The landing page is built using Webflow, and the solution can leverage available Webflow plugins to manage the cookie consent prompt.

Problem Statement
Without the implementation of a cookie consent mechanism, CATAPA may face non-compliance with UU PDP, resulting in potential legal and financial risks.

Objective
To ensure that CATAPA is compliant with the Indonesian UU PDP law by implementing a cookie consent mechanism on the landing page, allowing users to give or deny consent for the use of cookies.

Current Implementation
The CATAPA landing page currently does not have any cookie consent feature or management system.

Cookie Consent for UU PDP Compliance

Appendix & Reference
Plugin Recommendation from Perplexity
Based on the flow diagram you've described and the requirements for compliance with UU PDP Indonesia, I recommend using the Enzuzo Data Privacy app for Webflow. This app offers features that align well with the flow you've outlined and provides robust cookie consent management capabilities[2][4].

Enzuzo Data Privacy for Webflow

Enzuzo is a comprehensive data privacy solution that can be easily integrated with Webflow sites. It offers the following features that match your requirements:

1. **Customizable Cookie Banner**: Enzuzo allows you to create a cookie consent banner that appears on the first visit, aligning with the ""First Visit?"" decision point in your flow[2][4].

2. **Preference Management**: Users can accept or reject cookies, and their preferences are stored for future visits[4].

3. **Granular Cookie Control**: Enzuzo enables you to categorize cookies (e.g., necessary, analytics) and manage them based on user preferences[2].

4. **Google Analytics Integration**: The app can be configured to enable or disable Google Analytics based on user consent[4].

5. **Compliance with Global Privacy Laws**: While specifically designed for GDPR and CCPA, Enzuzo's features can be adapted to comply with UU PDP Indonesia[4].

6. **Consent Logs and Analytics**: Enzuzo maintains audit logs of user consent, which is crucial for compliance[4].

###

Cookie Consent for UU PDP Compliance

Implementation Steps

1. Install the Enzuzo Data Privacy app from the Webflow App Store[4].

2. Configure the cookie banner to appear on the first visit.

3. Set up cookie categories, ensuring ""necessary"" cookies are separate from others.

4. Configure Google Analytics to only run when the appropriate consent is given.

5. Customize the consent banner and preference center to align with UU PDP Indonesia requirements.

6. Implement the storage of user preferences for subsequent visits.

While Enzuzo doesn't explicitly mention UU PDP Indonesia compliance, its flexible features allow you to configure it to meet the requirements of this law. You may need to consult with a legal expert to ensure all aspects of UU PDP Indonesia are covered in your implementation.

By using Enzuzo, you can create a cookie consent flow that closely matches your diagram, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations while providing a smooth user experience on your Webflow site[2][4].

Background
CATAPA provides a centralized logging system that captures user actions and system events for core modules and Time Management module. These logs are accessible through the general Log in Admin Panel menu.

However, CATAPA currently does not support logging for extension. This means that any activity occurring in an extension—such as the Time Management Extension or Applicant Management, developed specifically for Djarum—is not captured in the platform’s logging system.

As a result, there is no way to trace, audit, or investigate actions that take place within these modules, which introduces operational risk and limits accountability for enterprise clients.

Problem Statement
CATAPA’s current system lacks the capability to capture and display logs for extension. While core modules and Time Management Module provide complete audit trails, activities performed within extension modules go entirely unlogged. This limitation causes several critical issues:

1)        There is no way to track what actions were performed, by whom, or when, which leads to confusion and reduces accountability.

2)        When data is modified (e.g., shift patterns, applicant status, etc.), there’s no visibility into historical values, making recovery or validation difficult.

3)        The lack of transparency forces clients to rely on support teams for answers that should be self-service, such as ""What changed?"" or ""Who did this?""

4)        Support and implementation teams are burdened with manual audits or database lookups to resolve issues — creating inefficiencies and increasing response times.

###

Extension Log

Objective
To enable traceability and accountability within extension modules by introducing a centralized Extension Log Viewer in CATAPA.

This feature aims to:

--        Provide a dedicated submenu called ""Extension Log"" under the existing Log menu, where all logs from extension modules can be accessed in one place.

--        Allow users to see what actions were performed, by whom, and when, across all active extensions.

--        Minimize reliance on support teams by enabling clients to self-audit and troubleshoot extension-related issues independently.

--        Ensure data change visibility (e.g., for shift patterns or applicant status), supporting validation and operational decision-making.

--        Align the extension logging behavior more closely with core modules to maintain consistency across the platform.

Solution
To address the logging gap for extension modules, CATAPA will implement a new submenu titled ""Extension Log"" under the existing Log menu. This log viewer will follow the same structure and behavior as CATAPA’s General Log, including table views, filters, and access to detailed information where available.

However, due to technical limitations, extension modules cannot utilize the existing service-utility used for core module logging. As a result, a new logging service will be developed specifically for extensions, allowing CATAPA to maintain a unified experience at the UI level while supporting the architectural boundaries between core and extension modules.

This log system will apply to modules such as Time Management Extension and Applicant Management, and will be scalable for future extensions.

Extension Log
Solution

The Extension Log page will include a filter panel to help users quickly locate relevant logs. The following filters will be available:

1)        Username

        a)        Text input field

        b)        Supports partial matching

2)        Menu

        a)        Dropdown list in the format: [Extension Name] - [Menu Name (optional)]

        b)        Dropdown values must be hardcoded by developers. If the name of an extension or menu changes, this list must be updated manually.

3)        Action

        a)        Dropdown list of standard CATAPA log actions:

                i)        Added

                ii)        Edited

                iii)        Deleted

                iv)        Canceled

                v)        Approved

                vi)        Rejected

                vii)        Processed

                viii)        Undid

                ix)        Imported

                x)        Exported

                xi)        Activated

                xii)        Deactivated

Background
Currently, overtime data storage in the backend manages HR-inputted overtime (overtime) and employee-submitted overtime requests from ESS (overtime entry approval) having dependencies on the current Overtime Table. This results in data mixing, where there is no distinction between HR-inputted overtime and ESS-submitted overtime requests that have been approved. To resolve this, we need to separate employee-submitted overtime requests from HR-inputted overtime at the database level.

With this separation, a new issue has emerged. Employees can no longer view their complete overtime data in the “View Overtime Entry History” menu because this menu retrieves data exclusively from the Overtime Entry Table, which only contains ESS-submitted overtime requests. This occurs in the following scenarios:

1)        If an overtime entry is submitted directly by HR via the apps, it does not appear in the “View Overtime Entry History” menu.

2)        If an approved overtime entry from ESS is later modified by HR, the updated version is only available in the Overtime Table and is no longer visible in the “View Overtime Entry History” menu.

To address this limitation, an enhancement will be introduced to the Time Management > Overtime menu in ESS. A new section will be added, similar to the UI in the Employee Management > Subordinate Overtime menu, to provide employees with a consolidated view of their overtime records.

###

Separate Overtime and Overtime Entry

Problem Statement
The current overtime data structure does not clearly differentiate between Overtime and Overtime Entry Approval. Overtime Entry Approval has dependencies on the Overtime Table, causing data mixing once an ESS request is approved. This makes it difficult to track the original source of an overtime entry, leading to challenges in approval management and historical tracking.

Additionally, there is an issue of incomplete overtime visibility in ESS:

--        The “View Overtime Entry History” menu retrieves data exclusively from the Overtime Entry Table, which only contains ESS-submitted overtime requests.

--        As a result, employees cannot see their full overtime history in the following cases:

        --        HR manually inputs overtime: It is stored in the Overtime Table and does not appear in the “View Overtime Entry History” menu.

        --        HR modifies an approved ESS overtime request: The updated entry is stored in the Overtime Table and does not reflect in the “View Overtime Entry History” menu.

Objective
To enhance data organization and tracking, we will:

1)        Create an Overtime Entry table to store all overtime requests submitted via ESS, including those waiting for approval, approved, and rejected.

2)        Ensure that HR-inputted overtime is stored only in the Overtime table.

3)        Ensure that once an ESS overtime request is approved, it is copied to the Overtime table while still remaining in the Overtime Entry table for historical tracking.

4)        Introduce a new section in the Time Management > Overtime menu in ESS.

5)        Ensure that this new section displays all overtime records for an employee, whether submitted via ESS or manually inputted by HR.

Background
Currently, overtime data storage in the backend manages HR-inputted overtime (overtime) and employee-submitted overtime requests from ESS (overtime entry approval) having dependencies on the current Overtime Table. This results in data mixing, where there is no distinction between HR-inputted overtime and ESS-submitted overtime requests that have been approved. To resolve this, we need to separate employee-submitted overtime requests from HR-inputted overtime at the database level.

With this separation, a new issue has emerged. Employees can no longer view their complete overtime data in the “View Overtime Entry History” menu because this menu retrieves data exclusively from the Overtime Entry Table, which only contains ESS-submitted overtime requests. This occurs in the following scenarios:

1)        If an overtime entry is submitted directly by HR via the apps, it does not appear in the “View Overtime Entry History” menu.

2)        If an approved overtime entry from ESS is later modified by HR, the updated version is only available in the Overtime Table and is no longer visible in the “View Overtime Entry History” menu.

To address this limitation, an enhancement will be introduced to the Time Management > Overtime menu in ESS. A new section will be added, similar to the UI in the Employee Management > Subordinate Overtime menu, to provide employees with a consolidated view of their overtime records.

###

Separate Overtime and Overtime Entry

Problem Statement
The current overtime data structure does not clearly differentiate between Overtime and Overtime Entry Approval. Overtime Entry Approval has dependencies on the Overtime Table, causing data mixing once an ESS request is approved. This makes it difficult to track the original source of an overtime entry, leading to challenges in approval management and historical tracking.

Additionally, there is an issue of incomplete overtime visibility in ESS:

--        The “View Overtime Entry History” menu retrieves data exclusively from the Overtime Entry Table, which only contains ESS-submitted overtime requests.

--        As a result, employees cannot see their full overtime history in the following cases:

        --        HR manually inputs overtime: It is stored in the Overtime Table and does not appear in the “View Overtime Entry History” menu.

        --        HR modifies an approved ESS overtime request: The updated entry is stored in the Overtime Table and does not reflect in the “View Overtime Entry History” menu.

Objective
To enhance data organization and tracking, we will:

1)        Create an Overtime Entry table to store all overtime requests submitted via ESS, including those waiting for approval, approved, and rejected.

2)        Ensure that HR-inputted overtime is stored only in the Overtime table.

3)        Ensure that once an ESS overtime request is approved, it is copied to the Overtime table while still remaining in the Overtime Entry table for historical tracking.

4)        Introduce a new section in the Time Management > Overtime menu in ESS.

5)        Ensure that this new section displays all overtime records for an employee, whether submitted via ESS or manually inputted by HR.

                i)        Pada fase ini payslip tidak dapat dikirimkan untuk karyawan terminated

3)        Sistem dapat menginformasikan:

        a)        Payslip hanya dapat dikirimkan via email untuk karyawan Aktif dan status emailnya sudah ENABLED

        b)        List karyawan aktif yang dipilih, tapi masih punya status email UNVERIFIED sehingga tidak dapat menerima email payslip

4)        HR/Admin dapat memilih apakah ingin mengirimkan payslip untuk salah satu / sebagian / seluruh payslip yang sudah tergenerate

5)        Sistem dapat menampilkan konfirmasi ulang sebelum payslip dikirimkan via email.

                ii)        Karyawan yang dapat mengakses ESS adalah karyawan yang memiliki user akses dan masih aktif

        b)        Claudia

                i)        Jika karyawan di setting dapat mengunduh payslip di menu [ESS Configuration](https://apps.catapa.com/dashboard/setup/settings/policy)

                ii)        Karyawan yang dapat mengakses ESS adalah karyawan yang memiliki user akses dan masih aktif

        c)        Apps CATAPA

                i)        Karyawan request payslip kepada HR/Admin

Konsep Off-Cycle Payment di CATAPA
1)        Pada awalnya, Additional Income (Penghasilan Tambahan) dibuat untuk memenuhi kebutuhan Perusahaan untuk membayarkan THR/Bonus.

        a)        Pajak atas penghasilan yang ditambahkan di Penghasilan Tambahan akan langsung dipetakan ke komponen pajak 07 Tantiem, Bonus, Gratifikasi, Jasa Produksi, dan THR (Irreguler)

        b)        Tidak ada mekanisme deduction karena premis di awal bahwa menu ini digunakan untuk THR/Bonus (hanya berupa income).

        c)        Pajak atas THR/Bonus akan langsung dihitung dan dipotong pada saat tanggal pembayaran

                i)        Tidak ada mekanisme untuk menggabungkan pajak atas penghasilan tambahan ke penggajian reguler

2)        Saat dikeluarkannya UU Cipta Kerja (UU No 11 Tahun 2020), terdapat kasus baru atas penghasilan tambahan yaitu Uang Kompensasi

        a)        Uang Kompensasi adalah Uang yang dibayarkan oleh perusahaan kepada karyawan kontrak setelah kontrak berakhir.

        b)        Umumnya masuk sebagai uang pesangon

        c)        Jika karyawan tersebut diperpanjang kontraknya, maka uang kompensasi atas kontrak yang lama akan diperlakukan seperti Bonus/THR

        d)        Atas kondisi ini ditambahkan suatu bagian baru di Additional Income CATAPA untuk memproses Uang Kompensasi

                i)        THR/Bonus diprorata dengan cara menghitung masa kerja dari tanggal acuan hingga tanggal penghasilan tambahan

                ii)        Uang Kompensasi diprorata dengan cara menghitung masa kerja dari tanggal kontrak dimulai hingga tanggal kontrak berakhir

                iii)        Uang Kompensasi memiliki aturan tambahan apakah tanggal acuan awal menggunakan tanggal kontrak dimulai atau tanggal berlakunya aturan UU Cipta Kerja (2 Nov 2021)

3)        Atas Reimbursement:

        a)        Hanya dapat dihitung pajaknya jika dibayarkan bersamaan dengan gaji reguler

3)        Atas Reimbursement:

        a)        Hanya dapat dihitung pajaknya jika dibayarkan bersamaan dengan gaji reguler

        b)        Belum dapat mengakomodir kebutuhan perhitungan pajak Reimbursement yang dibayar terpisah dengan gaji reguler

        c)        Fitur dalam maintenance mode sehingga tidak akan ada development apapun.

4)        Atas Time Management

        a)        Adanya premis Upah Lembur yang selalu dibayarkan dengan gaji reguler

5)        Atas Bonus/THR

        a)        Formula yang ditawarkan masih MVP

        b)        Pada kenyataannya, banyak formula yang belum didukung oleh Additional Income CATAPA karena keterbatasan sistem

                i)        Variable hanya dapat menggunakan salary item Individual

                ii)        Hanya dapat menggunakan nilai dari SK gaji terbaru (tidak bisa mengambil nilai dari SK gaji sebelumnya)

                iii)        Tidak dapat menentukan nominal berdasarkan kondisi per karyawan (if conditional)

Pembayaran Off-Cycle
1)        [Domain Knowledge] Terdapat 2 tipe pembayaran gaji sebagai berikut:

        a)        Pembayaran on-cycle

                i)        Pembayaran upah pokok yang dilakukan secara rutin dan reguler (semisal setiap bulan, setiap minggu)

        b)        Pembayaran off-cycle

                i)        Pembayaran upah yang dapat dibayarkan terpisah dari periode gaji reguler

                ii)        Contoh pembayaran off-cycle:

                        1)        Pembayaran Upah Di Muka (lebih dulu dari gaji reguler)

                        2)        Kompensasi tambahan diluar gaji reguler

                                a)        Bonus

                                b)        THR

                                c)        Upah Lembur

                                d)        Upah jasa produksi

                                e)        Pencairan pinjaman

                                f)        Reimburse

                        3)        Pembayaran Upah Karyawan yang Berhenti/Diberhentikan diluar jadwal penggajian reguler

                                a)        Pesangon

                                b)        Hak mantan pekerja lainnya

                        4)        Pembayaran atas kesalahan perhitungan dari penggajian sebelumnya

                        5)        Kasus retroaktif (perubahan SK gaji, perubahan tunjangan karena perubahan data kehadiran, dll)

2)        [Studi Kasus] Beberapa studi kasus terkait off-cycle payment

        a)        BCA - Reimbursement

                i)        BCA dapat membayarkan reimbursement yang terpisah dengan gaji reguler

                ii)        Perhitungan pajak atas reimbursement akan digabungkan dengan gaji reguler nantinya. Akan tetapi, dengan sistem saat ini User dapat memilih apakah ingin digabungkan dengan gaji reguler bulan ini atau bulan depan.

                iii)        Key takeaways:

                        1)        Sistem seharusnya dapat menyediakan mekanisme off-cycle payment dengan perhitungan pajak yang sesuai dengan komponen gajinya (Reguler dan Irreguler)

                        2)        Sistem dapat mengakomodir kebutuhan perhitungan pajak off-cycle payment yang digabungkan dengan gaji reguler

        b)        BCA - Bonus

                i)        BCA dapat memberikan Bonus yang dihitung berdasarkan nilai performance karyawan

                ii)        BCA dapat memberikan Bonus yang dihitung berdasarkan masa kerja karyawan

Konsep Off-Cycle Payment di CATAPA
1)        Pada awalnya, Additional Income (Penghasilan Tambahan) dibuat untuk memenuhi kebutuhan Perusahaan untuk membayarkan THR/Bonus.

        a)        Pajak atas penghasilan yang ditambahkan di Penghasilan Tambahan akan langsung dipetakan ke komponen pajak 07 Tantiem, Bonus, Gratifikasi, Jasa Produksi, dan THR (Irreguler)

        b)        Tidak ada mekanisme deduction karena premis di awal bahwa menu ini digunakan untuk THR/Bonus (hanya berupa income).

        c)        Pajak atas THR/Bonus akan langsung dihitung dan dipotong pada saat tanggal pembayaran

                i)        Tidak ada mekanisme untuk menggabungkan pajak atas penghasilan tambahan ke penggajian reguler

2)        Saat dikeluarkannya UU Cipta Kerja (UU No 11 Tahun 2020), terdapat kasus baru atas penghasilan tambahan yaitu Uang Kompensasi

        a)        Uang Kompensasi adalah Uang yang dibayarkan oleh perusahaan kepada karyawan kontrak setelah kontrak berakhir.

        b)        Umumnya masuk sebagai uang pesangon

        c)        Jika karyawan tersebut diperpanjang kontraknya, maka uang kompensasi atas kontrak yang lama akan diperlakukan seperti Bonus/THR

        d)        Atas kondisi ini ditambahkan suatu bagian baru di Additional Income CATAPA untuk memproses Uang Kompensasi

                i)        THR/Bonus diprorata dengan cara menghitung masa kerja dari tanggal acuan hingga tanggal penghasilan tambahan

                ii)        Uang Kompensasi diprorata dengan cara menghitung masa kerja dari tanggal kontrak dimulai hingga tanggal kontrak berakhir

                iii)        Uang Kompensasi memiliki aturan tambahan apakah tanggal acuan awal menggunakan tanggal kontrak dimulai atau tanggal berlakunya aturan UU Cipta Kerja (2 Nov 2021)

3)        Atas Reimbursement:

        a)        Hanya dapat dihitung pajaknya jika dibayarkan bersamaan dengan gaji reguler

3)        Atas Reimbursement:

        a)        Hanya dapat dihitung pajaknya jika dibayarkan bersamaan dengan gaji reguler

        b)        Belum dapat mengakomodir kebutuhan perhitungan pajak Reimbursement yang dibayar terpisah dengan gaji reguler

        c)        Fitur dalam maintenance mode sehingga tidak akan ada development apapun.

4)        Atas Time Management

        a)        Adanya premis Upah Lembur yang selalu dibayarkan dengan gaji reguler

5)        Atas Bonus/THR

        a)        Formula yang ditawarkan masih MVP

        b)        Pada kenyataannya, banyak formula yang belum didukung oleh Additional Income CATAPA karena keterbatasan sistem

                i)        Variable hanya dapat menggunakan salary item Individual

                ii)        Hanya dapat menggunakan nilai dari SK gaji terbaru (tidak bisa mengambil nilai dari SK gaji sebelumnya)

                iii)        Tidak dapat menentukan nominal berdasarkan kondisi per karyawan (if conditional)

Background
Sebelum melakukan proses pada CATAPA, user perlu melakukan update data bank dari karyawan. Update dapat dilakukan secara individu maupun massal. Ketika melakukan update secara massal, ada beberapa pain points yang dirasakan user:

1)	[SOLVED BUG FIX, NEED MORE IMPROVEMENT] Kebingungan karena data berhasil terupload tetapi data bank karyawan tidak berubah

	a)	Hal ini terjadi karena format data pada excel yang digunakan bukan bertipe STRING (tidak ada segitiga hijau pada excel ketika dibuka). Ketika upload tampil data berhasil namun tidak ada update pada data karyawan

	b)	Sudah diperbaiki, data dapat diupload meskipun tidak bertipe STRING

	c)	Sistem sekarang dapat menerima data character dan tetap memunculkan pesan berhasil. Meskipun berhasil, data Payment Method karyawan tidak akan berubah

	d)	Perlu adanya validasi untuk memastikan format data sesuai dan agar status yang tampil sesuai

2)	User dapat melakukan pembayaran gaji menggunakan Bank Transfer meskipun Bank Account kosong

	a)	User yang sudah melakukan update Payment Method Bank Transfer bisa saja belum memasukkan informasi Bank Account

	b)	Ketika dilakukan Salary Payment, proses tetap berjalan. Namun, Payment Method karyawan berubah menjadi Cash

	c)	Behavior expected karena tidak ada informasi Bank Account. Namun, tidak ada konfirmasi ketika ingin melakukan pemrosesan. User bisa saja tidak menyadari adanya perubahan Payment Method

	d)	Perlu adanya enhancement untuk meminimalisir human error

Objective
1)	Memastikan data dapat terupdate dengan sesuai

2)	Memastikan tidak ada false information dari sistem ke user

3)	Mengurangi possible human error dari user

2)	Memastikan tidak ada false information dari sistem ke user

3)	Mengurangi possible human error dari user

Current Implementation
1)	Bank Account Validation

	a)	Validasi tidak menampilkan informasi ke user. Validasi dilakukan untuk menjaga agar field yang tidak sesuai tidak terupdate. Namun, tidak ada informasi ke user bahwa format data yang diupload tidak sesuai.

	b)	Jika Payment Method diisi Bank Transfer namun Bank Account kosong, akan tetap berhasil namun data tidak terupdate

	c)	Jika field Bank Account number diisi string, akan tetap berhasil namun data tidak terupdate

	d)	Jika field Bank Account number diisi angka < 9 dikit, akan tetap berhasil namun data tidak terupdate

2)	Empty Bank Account

	a)	Payment Method otomatis berubah menjadi Cash ketika terjadi salary payment dengan empty bank account payment method bank transfer

Revision History

Background
Sebelum melakukan proses pada CATAPA, user perlu melakukan update data bank dari karyawan. Update dapat dilakukan secara individu maupun massal. Ketika melakukan update secara massal, ada beberapa pain points yang dirasakan user:

1)	[SOLVED BUG FIX, NEED MORE IMPROVEMENT] Kebingungan karena data berhasil terupload tetapi data bank karyawan tidak berubah

	a)	Hal ini terjadi karena format data pada excel yang digunakan bukan bertipe STRING (tidak ada segitiga hijau pada excel ketika dibuka). Ketika upload tampil data berhasil namun tidak ada update pada data karyawan

	b)	Sudah diperbaiki, data dapat diupload meskipun tidak bertipe STRING

	c)	Sistem sekarang dapat menerima data character dan tetap memunculkan pesan berhasil. Meskipun berhasil, data Payment Method karyawan tidak akan berubah

	d)	Perlu adanya validasi untuk memastikan format data sesuai dan agar status yang tampil sesuai

2)	User dapat melakukan pembayaran gaji menggunakan Bank Transfer meskipun Bank Account kosong

	a)	User yang sudah melakukan update Payment Method Bank Transfer bisa saja belum memasukkan informasi Bank Account

	b)	Ketika dilakukan Salary Payment, proses tetap berjalan. Namun, Payment Method karyawan berubah menjadi Cash

	c)	Behavior expected karena tidak ada informasi Bank Account. Namun, tidak ada konfirmasi ketika ingin melakukan pemrosesan. User bisa saja tidak menyadari adanya perubahan Payment Method

	d)	Perlu adanya enhancement untuk meminimalisir human error

Objective
1)	Memastikan data dapat terupdate dengan sesuai

2)	Memastikan tidak ada false information dari sistem ke user

3)	Mengurangi possible human error dari user

1)	Memastikan data dapat terupdate dengan sesuai

2)	Memastikan tidak ada false information dari sistem ke user

3)	Mengurangi possible human error dari user

Current Implementation
1)	Bank Account Validation

	a)	Validasi tidak menampilkan informasi ke user. Validasi dilakukan untuk menjaga agar field yang tidak sesuai tidak terupdate. Namun, tidak ada informasi ke user bahwa format data yang diupload tidak sesuai.

	b)	Jika Payment Method diisi Bank Transfer namun Bank Account kosong, akan tetap berhasil namun data tidak terupdate

	c)	Jika field Bank Account number diisi string, akan tetap berhasil namun data tidak terupdate

	d)	Jika field Bank Account number diisi angka < 9 dikit, akan tetap berhasil namun data tidak terupdate

2)	Empty Bank Account

	a)	Payment Method otomatis berubah menjadi Cash ketika terjadi salary payment dengan empty bank account payment method bank transfer

Background
CATAPA Platform currently provides an OAuth 2.0 Clients module used to generate client IDs and client secrets, as well as configure access to CATAPA Public API endpoints.

For Djarum’s integration needs, CATAPA developed 20 custom BAPI-based APIs that are not part of the standard public API set. However, the existing OAuth 2.0 Clients module does not support fine-grained permission configuration for these 20 custom APIs.

To support Djarum and similar enterprise use cases, a new feature—Extension OAuth 2.0 Clients—is required in the CATAPA Extension Platform. This feature allows administrators to manage which custom APIs each client ID is allowed to access.

Additionally, a scheduler is needed to ensure consistency of client ID data between Platform OAuth Clients and extension-level stored permissions.

Problem Statement
Today, the system faces the following issues:

1)	There is no mechanism to configure which of the 20 custom APIs can be accessed by a specific client ID.

2)	Extension-level stored permissions can become stale, because client IDs deleted from the platform are not automatically removed in the extension database.

3)	There is no UI to manage custom API access permissions at the client level.

4)	There is no API-level authorization logic to enforce that only allowed client IDs may call specific custom APIs.

Consequences:

1)	No granular control → all clients can access all custom APIs (security risk).

2)	Data inconsistency between platform and extension.

3)	Admin cannot selectively allow or restrict sensitive custom API operations.

Objective and Goals

###

Djarum - Extension OAuth 2.0 Clients

5.2 Data Storage
Extension database stores:

1)	client_id

2)	authorized_endpoints

3)	Timestamps (created_date, updated_date)

5.3 Daily Scheduler
Run every day at 00:00.

Responsibilities:

1)	Fetch client IDs from platform.

2)	Compare with extension DB records.

3)	If a client ID in the extension no longer exists in the platform:

	a)	Delete the record (stale cleanup).

Scheduler is idempotent.

5.4 API Access Validation
For every request made to a Djarum Custom API:

1)	Check required platform permissions

	a)	The client must have access to the mandatory platform OAuth endpoints.

		i)	The client ID must have permission to call: GET /v1/oauth-clients/validate-access-token.

	b)	If these prerequisites are missing → the custom API cannot be used, return 403 Forbidden.

2)	Check extension-level custom API permission

	a)	Verify whether the client is allowed to call the specific custom API.

	b)	If not allowed → return 403 Forbidden.

	c)	If allowed → continue processing the request as usual.

5.5 Role & Permission

Loan Entry Based on Loan Installment Amount
Revision History

Solution
Menambahkan menu radio button pada Loan Entry. Menu Calculation Reference memuat opsi entri pinjaman berdasarkan Installment Period atau Installment Amount. Jika menggunakan opsi Installment Period, maka perhitungan akan berlaku as-is seperti implementasi pada sistem yang sudah berlaku. Jika menggunakan opsi Installment Amount, maka periode akan dihitung dan dibulatkan ke atas. Sisa pinjaman akan ditagihkan pada periode terakhir. Behaviour ini belum terdapat pada kompetitor (Talenta).

Contoh kasus:

1)	Loan Amount Rp21.000.000,00

	a)	Menggunakan Calculation Reference Installment Period (as-is)

		i)	User input periode 7 bulan

		ii)	Sistem akan menampilkan Installment Amount Rp3.000.000,00

	b)	Menggunakan Calculation Reference Installment Amount

		i)	User input Installment Amount Rp3.000.000,00

		ii)	Sistem akan menampilkan Installment period 7 bulan

	c)	Menggunakan Calculation Reference Installment Amount, pembagian tidak bulat

		i)	User input Installment Amount Rp2.000.000,00

		ii)	Pada periode 1-10, cicilan akan ditagihkan sebesar Rp2.000.000,00

		iii)	Pada periode ke-11 (terakhir), cicilan ditagihkan sebesar Rp1.000.000,00

		iv)	Perhitungan menggunakan mod

Jika ada bunga yang digunakan pada pinjaman, maka nilai yang dimasukkan pada Installment Amount merupakan nilai sebelum ditambah bunga pinjaman. Untuk mewujudkan Loan Entry berdasarkan Installment Amount, BE perlu menambahkan informasi Installment Amount dan enum divider pada loan entry. API dan ESS perlu disesuaikan mengikuti Loan Entry yang baru.

Possible Use Case:

1)	Hasil pembagian Loan Amount/Installment Amount bukan integer

	a)	Digunakan ceiling function ⌈Loan Amount/Installment Amount⌉.

Loan Entry Based on Loan Installment Amount
Revision History

Solution
Menambahkan menu radio button pada Loan Entry. Menu Calculation Reference memuat opsi entri pinjaman berdasarkan Installment Period atau Installment Amount. Jika menggunakan opsi Installment Period, maka perhitungan akan berlaku as-is seperti implementasi pada sistem yang sudah berlaku. Jika menggunakan opsi Installment Amount, maka periode akan dihitung dan dibulatkan ke atas. Sisa pinjaman akan ditagihkan pada periode terakhir. Behaviour ini belum terdapat pada kompetitor (Talenta).

Contoh kasus:

1)        Loan Amount Rp21.000.000,00

        a)        Menggunakan Calculation Reference Installment Period (as-is)

                i)        User input periode 7 bulan

                ii)        Sistem akan menampilkan Installment Amount Rp3.000.000,00

        b)        Menggunakan Calculation Reference Installment Amount

                i)        User input Installment Amount Rp3.000.000,00

                ii)        Sistem akan menampilkan Installment period 7 bulan

        c)        Menggunakan Calculation Reference Installment Amount, pembagian tidak bulat

                i)        User input Installment Amount Rp2.000.000,00

                ii)        Pada periode 1-10, cicilan akan ditagihkan sebesar Rp2.000.000,00

                iii)        Pada periode ke-11 (terakhir), cicilan ditagihkan sebesar Rp1.000.000,00

                iv)        Perhitungan menggunakan mod

Jika ada bunga yang digunakan pada pinjaman, maka nilai yang dimasukkan pada Installment Amount merupakan nilai sebelum ditambah bunga pinjaman. Untuk mewujudkan Loan Entry berdasarkan Installment Amount, BE perlu menambahkan informasi Installment Amount dan enum divider pada loan entry. API dan ESS perlu disesuaikan mengikuti Loan Entry yang baru.

Possible Use Case:

1)        Hasil pembagian Loan Amount/Installment Amount bukan integer

        a)        Digunakan ceiling function ⌈Loan Amount/Installment Amount⌉.

Background
In the CATAPA system, users are currently required to manually input the codes for setting up Organization and Position. This manual process can lead to inconsistencies, errors, and inefficiencies, especially as the organization grows and the number of entries increases.

###

Employee Registration Enhancement

Problem Statement
The current employee registration system mandates username creation even for employees who will never access CATAPA, while also preventing non-OM tenants from assigning cost centers during initial registration. This results in unnecessary data collection, incomplete employee profiles at registration, and additional administrative steps that delay accurate financial reporting.

Objective and Goals
1)	Transform the username field from mandatory to optional in employee registration to accommodate employees who don't require system access

2)	Add cost center field in employee registration form to enable complete financial data capture during initial employee creation

Assumptions
-

Current Implementation
Currently, the employee registration form:

--	Username: Mandatory field for all employees

--	User Email: Optional because not all user will have email address

--	Cost Center: Not available in registration form for OM OFF tenant; must be added through employment data update

--	Implementation spans across web application, massive update functionality, and API endpoints

Competitive Analysis

Backdated Data Changes in Employment Data

Background
See base PRD: [PRD202504W2 - Backdated Data Changes for Payroll Related Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VFW_5R-3vbWOah9tnIts9wk2bk_itneACpiaz1k3Ifs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.pxx3fq71xird) and [[PRD] Migration Tools Transactional Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GfnelBoGtrgc3MEIZ5HStOidEkzuoCE3LD7qhsojpzs/edit?gid=1712256141#gid=1712256141)

Currently, CATAPA’s employment data update mechanism works much like a stack:

--	A new record can only be created after the previous record.

--	Past employment data cannot be edited once saved.

Additionally, there is an increasing urgency for a migration tool that supports backdated data. Since migration runs in batches based on the “changed on” date, the creation of backdated entries is inevitable.

Problem Statement
See base PRD: [PRD202504W2 - Backdated Data Changes for Payroll Related Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VFW_5R-3vbWOah9tnIts9wk2bk_itneACpiaz1k3Ifs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.pxx3fq71xird) and [[PRD] Migration Tools Transactional Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GfnelBoGtrgc3MEIZ5HStOidEkzuoCE3LD7qhsojpzs/edit?gid=1712256141#gid=1712256141)

Objective
1)	Assess the side effects of the Effective-Date Monotonicity Removal on Employment Data, especially on the Time Management Module and the Benefit Management Module

2)	Remove Effective-Date Monotonicity on Employment Data: Users will be allowed to enter or update records using any effective date, including ones that are the same as or earlier than existing entries. No restrictions will be applied at the system level.

Prevent Unintended Administrator Access Loss During Employee Termination 
Functional Requirements

The solution chosen is Solution 7. When terminating an employee with username “admin”, the system will block the termination process, showing an error message that the username “admin” should be transferred to another employee or remove the employee linked. This error message also shows on termination massive update.

Problem Statement
The current employee registration system mandates username creation even for employees who will never access CATAPA, while also preventing non-OM tenants from assigning cost centers during initial registration. This results in unnecessary data collection, incomplete employee profiles at registration, and additional administrative steps that delay accurate financial reporting.

Objective and Goals
1)        Transform the username field from mandatory to optional in employee registration to accommodate employees who don't require system access

2)        Add cost center field in employee registration form to enable complete financial data capture during initial employee creation

Assumptions
-

Current Implementation
Currently, the employee registration form:

--        Username: Mandatory field for all employees

--        User Email: Optional because not all user will have email address

--        Cost Center: Not available in registration form for OM OFF tenant; must be added through employment data update

--        Implementation spans across web application, massive update functionality, and API endpoints

Backdated Data Changes in Employment Data

Background
See base PRD: [PRD202504W2 - Backdated Data Changes for Payroll Related Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VFW_5R-3vbWOah9tnIts9wk2bk_itneACpiaz1k3Ifs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.pxx3fq71xird) and [[PRD] Migration Tools Transactional Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GfnelBoGtrgc3MEIZ5HStOidEkzuoCE3LD7qhsojpzs/edit?gid=1712256141#gid=1712256141)

Currently, CATAPA’s employment data update mechanism works much like a stack:

--        A new record can only be created after the previous record.

--        Past employment data cannot be edited once saved.

Additionally, there is an increasing urgency for a migration tool that supports backdated data. Since migration runs in batches based on the “changed on” date, the creation of backdated entries is inevitable.

Problem Statement
See base PRD: [PRD202504W2 - Backdated Data Changes for Payroll Related Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VFW_5R-3vbWOah9tnIts9wk2bk_itneACpiaz1k3Ifs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.pxx3fq71xird) and [[PRD] Migration Tools Transactional Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GfnelBoGtrgc3MEIZ5HStOidEkzuoCE3LD7qhsojpzs/edit?gid=1712256141#gid=1712256141)

Objective
1)        Assess the side effects of the Effective-Date Monotonicity Removal on Employment Data, especially on the Time Management Module and the Benefit Management Module

2)        Remove Effective-Date Monotonicity on Employment Data: Users will be allowed to enter or update records using any effective date, including ones that are the same as or earlier than existing entries. No restrictions will be applied at the system level.

Prevent Unintended Administrator Access Loss During Employee Termination 
Functional Requirements

The solution chosen is Solution 7. When terminating an employee with username “admin”, the system will block the termination process, showing an error message that the username “admin” should be transferred to another employee or remove the employee linked. This error message also shows on termination massive update.

Background
Currently, our payroll system requires users to update salary decrees (SK gaji) whenever there are changes in employment data to ensure synchronization. This process involves two separate updates: one for the employment data in the employee modules and another for the salary decree in payroll modules. This duplication of effort often results in inconsistencies and coordination issues, particularly when different teams manage employment and payroll data.

Problem Statement
The current process requires manual updating of both employment data and salary decrees separately, which is inefficient due to double effort and particularly challenging when different teams handle different scopes, requiring additional coordination to ensure data synchronization.

From a system perspective, storing the same data in multiple places is not considered scalable. It leads to a higher potential for errors and increased maintenance efforts. A scalable system relies on a single source of truth to ensure consistency and efficiency.

Objective
To streamline the payroll process by ensuring that employment data updates automatically reflect in payroll calculations and reports, thereby eliminating the need to update data separately. This will reduce errors, save time, and improve data consistency across the system.

In addition, this will be a stepping stone to create a new feature: [Salary by Employee Attribute](https://docs.google.com/document/d/197S3eWej-J3_5qP8LfoKKYp1aHfZ4HH8SwwvuX_dloo/edit#heading=h.pxx3fq71xird). By not storing employment data in the salary decree, the data can be managed independently, allowing for more flexibility.

Employment Data as Source of Truth
Solution

Tenant Survey
By the end of 2023, about 123 tenants had differences between their employment data and salary decrees. We sent out a survey asking if they wanted their salary by job to automatically update with changes in employment data.

19 out of 123 tenants have answered.

1)	84.21% agreed

	a)	37.5% (6 out of 16) of them are sister companies

2)	5.27% no issue

	a)	Because they use editable

	b)	All of them is not sister company

3)	10.52% did not agree

	a)	Turns out all of the users does not use salary by job

	b)	All of them is not sister company

In 2024, we did another survey of tenants who have salary by job, whether they are sister companies or not. The questions were: (a) whether users are aware that any employment data changes are not automatically reflected in salary decree (b) if they are aware why they intentionally make the data different, if they are not aware do they think it is supposed to be automatically updated in payroll.

6 out of 25 tenants have answered.

1)	50% of the tenants said they were not aware that the employment data is not synced.

2)	33.33% said there might be cases when employment data’s changed (promotion) but they don’t want the salary by job’s amount to change (still using the previous amount)

3)	100% agree that employment data should reflect in payroll*

*Such as payroll report but not necessarily automatically change the salary by job amount

Although the tenant participation was not high, based on the survey it shows that the majority agreed to have employment data as reference in payroll (automatically sync without manual update salary decree).

But, we need to be cautious and find any gaps that might be potential issues with the proposed solution–which is option 2 (implement employment data as the source of truth).

I. INTRODUCTION

Developing new and innovative sensors for smart phones will help open the field to new possibilities and fuel innova- tion. In particular, developing sensors that allow smart phones to perceive depth is key. Google's Advanced Technology and Projects Team share this vision. They are currently working on a smart phone that uses custom hardware to perceive depth. The project is nicknamed: ""Project Tango"" [4]. Engineers at NASA have also partnered with the Google team to attach these phones to robots that will be sent to the international space station [5]. However, Google's structured light sensor does not perform well in outdoor environments, since the light from the sun interferes with the sensor. In this paper we explore the possibility of using sonar to provide depth sensing capabilities in both indoor and outdoor environments and address two unique research questions: 1) How do we design a sonar sensor for smart phones using only the phone's existing hardware? 2) How do environmental factors such as noise, reverberation and temperature affect the sensor's accuracy ?.

The proposed sonar sensor uses the smart phone's rear speaker and microphone, and implements the sonar capabilities

on a software platform. The software process is comprised of three major steps: 1) a signal generation step, 2) a signal capture step, and 3) a signal processing step. During the signal generation step, the phone's rear speaker emits a pulse. The pulse forms a pressure wave which travels through the air until it encounters an object, which then reflects the pulse and scatters it in multiple directions. During the signal capture step, the microphone captures the reflected pulse, and the distance to the object is determined by calculating the time between the pulse and its reflection.

The system is comprised of three major components: 1) a signal generation component, 2) a signal capture component and 3) a signal processing component. Figure 3 shows an overview of these components. The signal generation com- ponent is responsible for generating the encoded pulse. This component is comprised of two sub-components: a pulse/chirp generation component and a windowing component. The sec- ond component is the signal capture component. The signal capture component records the signal that is reflected from the object. The third component is the signal processing compo- nent. The signal processing component filters the signal and calculates the time between the initial pulse and its reflection. This component is comprised of two sub-components. The first component is the filtering component and the second sub- component is the peak detection component. We discuss each component in detail in the following sections.

the second subprocess shapes the encoded pulse. We discuss each part of the process in a separate subsection. We begin by discussing the pulse encoding process which is also called pulse compression.

1) Pulse Compression: Pulse compression makes it easier to recover a pulse by encoding the pulse with a unique signature. The pulse can be encoded using amplitude mod- ulation or frequency modulation. Amplitude modulation is the process of encoding a wave by increasing or decreasing the amplitude of sections of the wave, while frequency modulation is the process of varying the frequency of different sections of the wave. The state of the art pulse compression approach uses frequency modulation to create an encoded pulse, since frequency modulation is less susceptible to noise [19]. The encoded pulse is known as a linear chirp. A linear chirp is a signal whose frequency increases linearly from a starting frequency to an ending frequency.

Figure 4a shows an image of the linear chirp in the time and frequency domain. The signal was sampled at 44.1kHz, so each sample index represents 0.227ps. The signal starts at a low frequency and progresses to a higher frequency.

Now that we have discussed the intuition behind a linear chirp, we will look at how the signal is generated. A linear chirp can be expressed as a sinusoidal function. Equation 1 describes how the amplitude of a linear chirp signal varies with time. The value f0 represents the initial frequency while the value k represents chirp rate (how quickly the frequency increases) and ¢. represents the phase of the pulse. The chirp rate can be determined using equation 2.

a(t) = sin 00 +2 ( fox+5 *+2)] (1)

###

TABLE I: Chirp properties table

Equation 1 represents the continuous time representation of a linear chirp. However, the signal must be discretized before it can be played by the phone's speaker. The signal is discretized by sampling equation 1 at specific time intervals. The time intervals are determined based on the sample rate and the pulse duration. In our implementation, a linear chirp was generated using the parameters shown in table I. Though

we have selected a linear chirp with these properties it is important to note that other linear chirps can be used with different frequencies and sweep times.

Now that we have discussed how the encoded pulse is generated, we will discuss how the pulse is shaped in the next section. This process of shaping the pulse is known as windowing.

2) Windowing the Pulse: The windowing process is the second subprocess of the signal generating process. The win- dowing subprocess shapes the pulse by passing it through a window. Shaping the pulse improves the pulse's signal to noise ratio by improving the peak to side lobe ratio. This becomes clearer when we compare the autocorrelated representation of the windowed signal in figure 4d with the unwindowed signal in figure 4b. Notice that the autocorrelated representa- tion of the windowed signal does not contain the additional peaks/sidelobes that are in the autocorrelated representation of the unwindowed signal.

###

A. Generating the Signal

The signal in figure 4c was windowed using a hanning window [20]. The pulse is shaped by multiplying it by a hanning window of the same length. The hanning window is described by equation 3. In equation 3, N represents the number of samples in the window and n represents the index of a sample. Since the pulse is 0.01s and the sample rate is 44.1kHz, the window has a length of 441 samples. The discretized pulse is shaped by performing an element-wise multiplication between the discretized pulse vector and the discretized hanning window. Finally, the discretized shaped pulse is sent to the speaker's buffer to be transmitted.

Background
CATAPA Platform currently provides an OAuth 2.0 Clients module used to generate client IDs and client secrets, as well as configure access to CATAPA Public API endpoints.

For Djarum’s integration needs, CATAPA developed 20 custom BAPI-based APIs that are not part of the standard public API set. However, the existing OAuth 2.0 Clients module does not support fine-grained permission configuration for these 20 custom APIs.

To support Djarum and similar enterprise use cases, a new feature—Extension OAuth 2.0 Clients—is required in the CATAPA Extension Platform. This feature allows administrators to manage which custom APIs each client ID is allowed to access.

Additionally, a scheduler is needed to ensure consistency of client ID data between Platform OAuth Clients and extension-level stored permissions.

Problem Statement
Today, the system faces the following issues:

1)	There is no mechanism to configure which of the 20 custom APIs can be accessed by a specific client ID.

2)	Extension-level stored permissions can become stale, because client IDs deleted from the platform are not automatically removed in the extension database.

3)	There is no UI to manage custom API access permissions at the client level.

4)	There is no API-level authorization logic to enforce that only allowed client IDs may call specific custom APIs.

Consequences:

1)	No granular control → all clients can access all custom APIs (security risk).

2)	Data inconsistency between platform and extension.

3)	Admin cannot selectively allow or restrict sensitive custom API operations.

Feature Specification: Extension OAuth 2.0 Clients

Clarifications

Session 2025-11-25

- Q: How frequently should the background scheduler sync with Platform OAuth 2.0 Clients? → A: Once per day at midnight

- Q: How quickly must orphaned records be removed after deletion from the platform? → A: Within 24 hours. The UI always calls the Platform API in real-time to display current client IDs, so the displayed list is always accurate. The daily sync is only for database cleanup.

- Q: What level of audit logging is required for access grants/revocations? → A: No audit logging required for initial phase. This will be added as a future enhancement.

- Q: Should the system implement optimistic locking or conflict detection for concurrent administrator edits? → A: No. Use simple last-save-wins approach. With fewer than 10 clients and minimal likelihood of concurrent edits, locking is unnecessary complexity.

**UI/UX Clarifications:**

- Q: When user loads the Edit Client view, what should the checkboxes display? → A: Show saved state - Load and display currently granted APIs from the extension database

- Q: Should the ""Select All"" button toggle or always select all? → A: Toggle behavior - If all are checked, it deselects all; if any are unchecked, it selects all

- Q: When clicking Cancel, should there be a confirmation dialog if changes were made? → A: No confirmation - Immediately return to list view and discard all unsaved changes

- Q: What should happen if a user tries to edit a client that was just deleted from Platform OAuth 2.0 Clients? → A: Show error message ""Client no longer exists in Platform OAuth 2.0 Clients"", then redirect to list view

5.2 Data Storage
Extension database stores:

1)	client_id

2)	authorized_endpoints

3)	Timestamps (created_date, updated_date)

5.3 Daily Scheduler
Run every day at 00:00.

Responsibilities:

1)	Fetch client IDs from platform.

2)	Compare with extension DB records.

3)	If a client ID in the extension no longer exists in the platform:

	a)	Delete the record (stale cleanup).

Scheduler is idempotent.

5.4 API Access Validation
For every request made to a Djarum Custom API:

1)	Check required platform permissions

	a)	The client must have access to the mandatory platform OAuth endpoints.

		i)	The client ID must have permission to call: GET /v1/oauth-clients/validate-access-token.

	b)	If these prerequisites are missing → the custom API cannot be used, return 403 Forbidden.

2)	Check extension-level custom API permission

	a)	Verify whether the client is allowed to call the specific custom API.

	b)	If not allowed → return 403 Forbidden.

	c)	If allowed → continue processing the request as usual.

5.5 Role & Permission
1)	Introduce a new extension-level trustee:

	a)	Extension OAuth 2.0 Client

		i)	View

		ii)	Manage

2)	Prerequisite for this role:

	a)	User must have Admin Panel – Extension access.

3)	Only authorized users may view or edit this menu.

2. Injected Requirements From Product Manager (Use As-Is)

Use the following requirements exactly as stated:

1. **Data storage**

   Data for Extension OAuth 2.0 Clients is stored in the extension database.

2. **Sync logic (stale record cleanup)**

   If a client_id exists in the extension but no longer exists in Platform OAuth 2.0 Clients →

   delete the extension record.

3. **Authentication / Access**

   No additional dependency.

   To call the custom API, the caller only needs:

   - valid client_id

   - client_secret

   - and the client_id must have access to the API

4. **UI Behavior**

   a. “Select All” applies ONLY to the 20 custom APIs

   b. Search operates ONLY within these 20 custom APIs

   c. User must manually grant access to required platform endpoints in Platform OAuth 2.0 Clients:

      - GET /v1/oauth-clients/validate-access-token

      - GET /v1/oauth-clients

4.2. PSO-BPNN RSSI Distance Model
It is difficult to accurately map the relationship between RSSI and distance with the logarithmic distance loss model. In this section, the PSO-BPNN Algorithm 1 is used to train the RSSI distance model. The PSO-BPNN is composed of a three-layer structure, including one input node, i hidden nodes, and one output node. The training sample input value is RSSI = { RSSI1, . . . , RSSIj, . .. , RSSIn}. The training sample output value is D = {d1, . . . , dj, . . . , dn}. As shown in Figure 5, wi is defined as the weights from the input layer to the hidden layer, 0¡ is defined as the threshold value of the hidden layer node, @j is defined as the weights from the hidden layer to the output layer, y is defined as the threshold value of the output layer node, and O is defined as the output of the neural network.

4.2. PSO-BPNN RSSI Distance Model

Figure 5. Neural network structure.

The PSO preliminarily optimizes the parameters of BPNN to avoid the BPNN falling into the local optimal solution. In the PSO algorithm, the potential solution of each optimization problem is imagined as a point in a x-dimensional space which is called a particle. The particle moves around in the search space according to simple mathematical formulae regarding the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is also influenced by its local best known position and the global best known position, which are found by the fitness function. After many iterations, the optimal positions of the particles and the extremum of the fitness function are calculated. In this paper, the fitness function is shown as

i=1 n

Fit = >di - 0i. (11)

The PSO iteration formula is

%+1 = uva+arı (Pia - xa) + c2r2 (Pg,d - cia) x+1 =xi,a+vặt1, (12)

where xid = {w),.W.,O .... ..... ], ...... .. 4} are the particles. u means the inertia weight, r1 and r2 are two random numbers in the range [0, 1]. c1 and c2 are two positive constants which is called learning factor or accelerating factor. C1 is used to adjusted the step length of the particle flying to its own best position. c2 is used to adjusted the step length of the particle flying to the swarm's best position. Pi,d is the optimal value searched by the i-th particle. Pg,d is the optimal value searched by the whole particle swarm.

Neural network weights and thresholds can be optimized through multiple iterations. The optimized weights and thresholds are assigned to the BPNN to further train the network model. The hidden layer output is (13)

5. Experiment

Figure 8. The standard deviation of the RSSI before and after correction.

In this paper, three methods were tested to fit the RSSI distance model, including the logarithmic distance loss model, BPNN, and PSO-BPNN. In the test, BPNN and PSO-BPNN adopted a single hidden layer network with five hidden layer nodes. The results of the tests are given in Figure 9. Figure 10 shows the normalized sum of squared errors (SSE) of the RSSI distance model fitted by three methods . The SSE of the logarithmic distance model fitting with the least squares algorithm was 0.29. The SSE of the RSSI distance model trained by the BP neural network was 0.30. The RSSI distance model trained by PSO-BPNN had the lowest error rate-the error rate was only 0.25-and it showed good robustness.

The results of the indoor positioning experiment are shown in Figure 11. Since the noise caused by the RSSI fluctuation cannot be eliminated, the traditional Kalman filtering method has great positioning error. By employing the Bluetooth gateway to correct RSSI in real-time, and further using PSO-BPNN to train the RSSI distance model, better positioning results were achieved. In 30 consecutive positioning tests, our method showed more stable positioning.

Figure 11. Comparison of the positioning results between the traditional and proposed methods.

We randomly selected eight test points in the office, and their positioning errors are shown in Figure 12. We can see that due to the fluctuation of the Bluetooth system, the positioning results were still poor even when the Kalman Filter was used. The root mean square error (RMSE) was 2.0361 m, the mean absolute error (MAE) was 1.8357 m, and the maximum positioning error was 3.29 m. The Kalman filter and PSO-BPNN RSSI distance model were able to effectively reduce the positioning error- the RMSE was 1.1279 m, the MAE was 0.9704 m, and the maximum positioning error was 2.21 m.

The method proposed in ref. [27] was able to reduce the error caused by the RSSI fluctuation, but it brings new error due to the approximate nature of the calculation. The RMSE was 0.9583 m, the MAE was 0.7882 m, and the maximum positioning error was 3.23 m. After correcting the RSSI and accurately estimating the RSSI distance model by the proposed method, the positioning accuracy improved obviously. The RMSE was only 0.7343 m, the MAE was 0.7018 m, and the maximum positioning error was only 1.61 m. The results show that the noise caused by the RSSI fluctuation was reduced and our algorithm provided a good positioning result.

6. Conclusions and Future Work
This paper presents an indoor location method for the dynamic correction of RSSI by deploying the Bluetooth gateway. The location of the Bluetooth gateway is not strictly required; it is only required that each anchor node can communicate with at least one Bluetooth gateway. In addition, we used the PSO-BPNN trained RSSI-distance model in the offline stage. Then, we used the proposed algorithm to correct the RSSI in real-time and used the Kalman filter to further smooth the data. After smoothing the RSSI, the distance between the blind node and the BLE node was estimated by the PSO-BPNN RSSI distance model. Finally we used the least squares algorithm to estimate the terminal position. The experimental results show that the algorithm can improve the positioning accuracy and meet the requirements of the indoor positioning system. In this paper, some special positions were not considered, like indoor corners and other complex electromagnetic regions. Moreover, it is difficult to obtain continuous positioning with high precision only by BLE positioning technology. Therefore, the proposed method can be further improved by fusion positioning with multiple sensors which could be investigated in the future, including the positioning in some special cases.

4.2. PSO-BPNN RSSI Distance Model
It is difficult to accurately map the relationship between RSSI and distance with the logarithmic distance loss model. In this section, the PSO-BPNN Algorithm 1 is used to train the RSSI distance model. The PSO-BPNN is composed of a three-layer structure, including one input node, i hidden nodes, and one output node. The training sample input value is RSSI = { RSSI1, . . . , RSSIj, . .. , RSSIn}. The training sample output value is D = {d1, . . . , dj, . . . , dn}. As shown in Figure 5, wi is defined as the weights from the input layer to the hidden layer, 0¡ is defined as the threshold value of the hidden layer node, @j is defined as the weights from the hidden layer to the output layer, y is defined as the threshold value of the output layer node, and O is defined as the output of the neural network.

4.2. PSO-BPNN RSSI Distance Model

Figure 5. Neural network structure.

The PSO preliminarily optimizes the parameters of BPNN to avoid the BPNN falling into the local optimal solution. In the PSO algorithm, the potential solution of each optimization problem is imagined as a point in a x-dimensional space which is called a particle. The particle moves around in the search space according to simple mathematical formulae regarding the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is also influenced by its local best known position and the global best known position, which are found by the fitness function. After many iterations, the optimal positions of the particles and the extremum of the fitness function are calculated. In this paper, the fitness function is shown as

i=1 n

Fit = >di - 0i. (11)

The PSO iteration formula is

%+1 = uva+arı (Pia - xa) + c2r2 (Pg,d - cia) x+1 =xi,a+vặt1, (12)

where xid = {w),.W.,O .... ..... ], ...... .. 4} are the particles. u means the inertia weight, r1 and r2 are two random numbers in the range [0, 1]. c1 and c2 are two positive constants which is called learning factor or accelerating factor. C1 is used to adjusted the step length of the particle flying to its own best position. c2 is used to adjusted the step length of the particle flying to the swarm's best position. Pi,d is the optimal value searched by the i-th particle. Pg,d is the optimal value searched by the whole particle swarm.

Neural network weights and thresholds can be optimized through multiple iterations. The optimized weights and thresholds are assigned to the BPNN to further train the network model. The hidden layer output is (13)

Figure 8. The standard deviation of the RSSI before and after correction.

In this paper, three methods were tested to fit the RSSI distance model, including the logarithmic distance loss model, BPNN, and PSO-BPNN. In the test, BPNN and PSO-BPNN adopted a single hidden layer network with five hidden layer nodes. The results of the tests are given in Figure 9. Figure 10 shows the normalized sum of squared errors (SSE) of the RSSI distance model fitted by three methods . The SSE of the logarithmic distance model fitting with the least squares algorithm was 0.29. The SSE of the RSSI distance model trained by the BP neural network was 0.30. The RSSI distance model trained by PSO-BPNN had the lowest error rate-the error rate was only 0.25-and it showed good robustness.

iBeacon periodically broadcasts only a few signals, including the universally unique identifier (UUID), major value, minor value, and transmissions (TX) power, to identify the beacon and calculate the distance, as shown in Figure 2. Thus, all indoor LBS are processed on smartphones and service servers.

In the case of the Estimote Beacon (Estimote Beacons are small wireless sensors based on BLE; they broadcast tiny radio signals that can be received and interpreted by smartphones, thereby facilitating microlocation and con- textual awareness; Estimote Beacons are tiny computers, each having a powerful Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) processor, memory, and bluetooth smart module; Estimote Beacons are certified to be compatible with iBeacon), which supports iBeacon, the signal transmission cycle and output can be easily modified using a specialized tool. Changing the signal transmission cycle and output will alter the dis- tance measured between the iBeacon transmitter and the smartphone [16]. However, modifying the signal output does not guarantee improved accuracy of the measured distance. Therefore, the measurement derived from the iBeacon signal has to be interpreted differently depending on the distance, as summarized in Table 1 [15].

Nevertheless, the definitions stated in Table 1 do not mean that the distance cannot be directly measured using iBeacon. In fact, it means that, in the case of distances estimated using

where PL is total path loss, PTx/PRx are transmitted and received signal strength, respectively, d is measured distance, do is standard distance (define: 1 m), X g is standard deviation (define: 0), and n is path loss exponent.

After substituting PRx(do) with -59 dBm, the signal strength for the 1 m reference point described in the iBeacon development document, (1), (2), (3), and (4) were used to calculate the relative distance measurement per RSSI signal strength.

Figure 9 shows measurements of the distance to the iBeacon transmitter from a distance of 1 m. The average of the six measurements to the iBeacon transmitter was 0.6 m, which had an error of 0.34 m. Figure 10 shows measurements of the distance to the iBeacon transmitter from a distance of 3 m. The average of the six measurements to the iBeacon transmitter was 1.39 m, which had an error of 1.61 m. Fig- ure 11 shows measurements of the distance to the iBeacon transmitter from a distance of 5 m. The average of the six measurements to the iBeacon transmitter was 2.21 m, which had an error of 2.79 m.

Thus, the distance measurements from the 1m, 3 m, and 5 m points resulted in errors of 0.34-2.79 m from the real distance. Based on this result, it can be confirmed that

while it is possible to measure the distance using only the iBeacon's RSSI value, an error would exist between the real and calculated distances. This is due to a number of factors that cause changes in the received RSSI value, such as the battery life, experiment environment, space configuration, human movement, and smartphone location and direction.

while it is possible to measure the distance using only the iBeacon's RSSI value, an error would exist between the real and calculated distances. This is due to a number of factors that cause changes in the received RSSI value, such as the battery life, experiment environment, space configuration, human movement, and smartphone location and direction.

Figure 12 shows the average measurement per unit distance. The average was calculated using the distance measured on the basis of the RSSI value determined from distances of 1m, 2m, 3m, 5m, and 10 m. Figure 13 shows the standard deviation of the measurements per distance. The distance was measured using 1 m, 2 m, 3 m, 5 m, and 10 m as reference points to verify the accuracy of the ""immediate,"" ""near,"" and ""far"" distances defined in the iBeacon devel- opment document. As can be seen, the deviation was not high when the measurement was taken from distances of 1 m and 2 m, but it increased for distances of 3 m and 5 m and increased further for 10 m.

4.2. Indoor Positioning Using Extended Kalman Filter. From the analysis of the iBeacon's signal property (Section 4.1), we confirmed that there were irregularities and variations in the measurements of the iBeacon RSSI according to the distance and the beacon. Because a single distance measurement using the iBeacon RSSI is not reliable, it is necessary to create a measurement noise model for application to an extended Kalman filter based on the result of the signal property analysis. Table 3 lists the inclination per section of the standard deviation shown in Figure 13.

where PL is total path loss, PTx/PRx are transmitted and received signal strength, respectively, d is measured distance, do is standard distance (define: 1 m), X g is standard deviation (define: 0), and n is path loss exponent.

After substituting PRx(do) with -59 dBm, the signal strength for the 1 m reference point described in the iBeacon development document, (1), (2), (3), and (4) were used to calculate the relative distance measurement per RSSI signal strength.

Figure 9 shows measurements of the distance to the iBeacon transmitter from a distance of 1 m. The average of the six measurements to the iBeacon transmitter was 0.6 m, which had an error of 0.34 m. Figure 10 shows measurements of the distance to the iBeacon transmitter from a distance of 3 m. The average of the six measurements to the iBeacon transmitter was 1.39 m, which had an error of 1.61 m. Fig- ure 11 shows measurements of the distance to the iBeacon transmitter from a distance of 5 m. The average of the six measurements to the iBeacon transmitter was 2.21 m, which had an error of 2.79 m.

Thus, the distance measurements from the 1m, 3 m, and 5 m points resulted in errors of 0.34-2.79 m from the real distance. Based on this result, it can be confirmed that

while it is possible to measure the distance using only the iBeacon's RSSI value, an error would exist between the real and calculated distances. This is due to a number of factors that cause changes in the received RSSI value, such as the battery life, experiment environment, space configuration, human movement, and smartphone location and direction.

while it is possible to measure the distance using only the iBeacon's RSSI value, an error would exist between the real and calculated distances. This is due to a number of factors that cause changes in the received RSSI value, such as the battery life, experiment environment, space configuration, human movement, and smartphone location and direction.

Figure 12 shows the average measurement per unit distance. The average was calculated using the distance measured on the basis of the RSSI value determined from distances of 1m, 2m, 3m, 5m, and 10 m. Figure 13 shows the standard deviation of the measurements per distance. The distance was measured using 1 m, 2 m, 3 m, 5 m, and 10 m as reference points to verify the accuracy of the ""immediate,"" ""near,"" and ""far"" distances defined in the iBeacon devel- opment document. As can be seen, the deviation was not high when the measurement was taken from distances of 1 m and 2 m, but it increased for distances of 3 m and 5 m and increased further for 10 m.

4.2. Indoor Positioning Using Extended Kalman Filter. From the analysis of the iBeacon's signal property (Section 4.1), we confirmed that there were irregularities and variations in the measurements of the iBeacon RSSI according to the distance and the beacon. Because a single distance measurement using the iBeacon RSSI is not reliable, it is necessary to create a measurement noise model for application to an extended Kalman filter based on the result of the signal property analysis. Table 3 lists the inclination per section of the standard deviation shown in Figure 13.

As can be seen in Table 3, BS6 is not a reliable measure- ment because of the irregular change in the deviation per

47,Jelaskan alur penanganan pembayaran akhir (Final Payment) bagi karyawan yang berhenti bekerja di UW dan kondisi teknologi apa yang membuat sistem menghasilkan pembayaran tersebut secara otomatis?,"Alur dimulai ketika Departemen/HR menerima notifikasi pemisahan karyawan (termasuk karena pensiun atau kematian) melalui teknologi. Payroll kemudian menginisiasi perhitungan pembayaran akhir yang mencakup sisa cuti (vacation), kompensasi waktu, dan penyesuaian kelebihan pembayaran (overpayments). Secara teknologi, sistem diintegrasikan dengan modul waktu dan kehadiran (T&A) untuk mendapatkan data pembayaran PTO akhir. Syarat agar pembayaran akhir (final payment) dapat dihasilkan secara otomatis oleh sistem adalah jika nilai pembayaran (payout) yang dihitung lebih besar daripada nilai kelebihan pembayaran (overpayment) yang ada. Setelah itu, cek dapat diberikan langsung ke karyawan atau diterima melalui siklus payroll reguler, dan status karyawan diubah menjadi 'Separated'.","[""152615-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-83"", ""152615-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-84"", ""152615-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-86"", ""152615-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-87"", ""152615-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-89"", ""152615-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-90""]","DRAFT

50,"Bagaimana gambaran umum alur proses penggajian On-Cycle di University of Washington, peran teknologi di dalamnya, serta definisi sistem ESS?","Proses penggajian On-Cycle di University of Washington (UW) berjalan secara berulang setiap setengah bulan (semi-monthly). Alur ini mencakup pengumpulan input data pembayaran, penerapan aturan pemotongan (withholding), perhitungan gaji bruto ke neto, serta pelaksanaan tugas pasca-bayar dan pembayaran pajak. Teknologi digunakan untuk mengotomatisasi perhitungan gaji berdasarkan jam kerja dan paket kompensasi secara akurat, serta memicu notifikasi ke bank mengenai jumlah pendanaan. Proses ini sangat mengutamakan pemilihan metode pembayaran melalui setoran langsung (direct deposit) atau Paycard. Untuk memudahkan interaksi, tersedia sistem Employee Self Service (ESS), yaitu situs berbasis web bagi karyawan untuk memperbarui informasi pribadi seperti alamat, W-4, info deposit, serta melihat rincian penggajian, manfaat, dan cuti mereka secara mandiri. Selain itu, sistem diintegrasikan dengan modul waktu dan kehadiran untuk mendukung kelancaran siklus ini. Seluruh dokumentasi ini bertujuan untuk memetakan peran, tanggung jawab, dan implikasi organisasi dari desain proses masa depan.","[""152614-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-14"", ""152614-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-15"", ""152614-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-38"", ""152614-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-45"", ""152614-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-47"", ""152614-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-58"", ""152614-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-75"", ""152614-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-83"", ""152614-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-130""]","Process Overview

Repository Enhancement
Solution Phase 1: Show in ESS and Massive Upload

C)	Repository in ESS
1)	Enable Employee Self-Service (ESS) access to repository documents, allowing employees to independently view and download their documents without HR intervention.

2)	Core Principle: Employees see only their own documents from categories marked as ""visible in ESS"", following the self-service pattern from Workday, Sunfish, and Talenta.

3)	Business value:

	a)	Eliminates the risk of exposing confidential documents to employees

	b)	Enables HR to use the repository confidently for sensitive files

	c)	Fulfills BCAI's core requirement (employees see tax docs, not internal files)

	d)	Improves compliance with data protection regulations

4)	ESS visibility toggle set up approach:

	a)	Options:

[image_f373231c0685557c]

Repository Enhancement
Solution Phase 1: Show in ESS and Massive Upload

D)	Repository Massive Upload
2)	Enable HR administrators to upload file simultaneously for multiple employees using a template-based approach (Excel + ZIP file), following the proven pattern from Sunfish, LinovHR, and Talenta.

3)	Core Principle: Validated before commit (prevent errors), and processed in the background (non-blocking).

4)	Rules:

	a)	Maximum number of files per upload:

		i)	Rules

Maximum per bulk upload:

- Total ZIP size: 500 MB maximum

- File count: 1,000 files maximum

- Must satisfy BOTH conditions

		ii)	Logic

Upload allowed if:

  (ZIP size ≤ 500 MB) AND (File count ≤ 1,000)

Solution
Based on the master PRD, Personal Data is a type 1 data group. This means this data group must have these qualities:

--        Continuous: The data may not have a “blank/null/empty” state in the middle of existing data history

--        Does not have an end date: The in-between data/record will assume the next record effective date minus one as the end date. The latest data/record will have an indefinite end date.

--        Mandatory start date: Every data entry must be accompanied by an effective date (start)

--        Non-overlapping: The data may not occupy the same effective period

Solution

A. New Field & General Behavior
Additional Input Fields (App and Massive Update)

1)        NEW Effective Date (Mandatory):

        --        Specifies when the Personal Data is valid/effective to be used by the organization

                i)        The effective date cannot be older than the birthdate

                ii)        The min(Join Date, today) will be used as the effective date during the employee creation

                        1)        To avoid “empty” state especially on employee join in the future

                iii)        The 1st/earliest Personal Data’s record effective date cannot be moved further (more future) than the employee Join Date. This ensures that the employee always has Personal Data “at least” after joining the company.

                iv)        The Join Date will be validated so that it cannot be moved earlier than the effective date for the earliest personal data. The reason is the same as point iii above.

        --        The subsequent record’s Effective Date - 1 Day will “serve” as the end date for the previous record

2)        Note: Date of Marriage is located/structured differently with SAP’s. It can be inferred from CATAPA’s Family data instead of Personal Data.

Behavior related to the effective date

1)        Creation

        a)        User can create and insert Personal Data: Personal Data can be created/inserted and not limited to past, current, and future data.

                i)        But not earlier than the employee’s birth date

        b)        1st time creation during employee creation

                i)        The  Personal Data will be created with effective date  =  min(Join Date, today)

        c)        Single Personal Data creation can be done via the Employee Details page by clicking on “Add new Personal Data”

        d)        Personal data creation must have an effective date that is different from the other records.

                i)        Prompt to notify the user that the action will overwrite a record

                ii)        The system will force the user to enter more future Effective Date compared to the latest record

        c)        Alternative #2 (Recommendation):

                iii)        Deletion that would result in an employee having no Personal Data after their Join Date will be prevented.

        b)        Deletion requires approval.

5)        ESS related

Historical Data for Personal Data
Solution

D. Migration
1)        Employee's min(Join Date, today) will serve as the effective date for the first record of their Personal Data in the current CATAPA system.

2)        Employee’s Date of Marriage will be left empty since it is an optional field and CATAPA currently does not have reliable date for it.

E. Effect on Other Modules/Features
1)        General rules:

        a)        The addition of an effective date must make the current API backward-compatible

        b)        Without entering the date parameter, the Personal Data should be able to return the current active Personal Data

2)        Potentially affected Modules:

        a)        Employee Name referenced by other modules

                i)        Past & today join date

                        1)        Since the employee always has Personal Data after the Join Date, use active Personal Data.

                ii)        Future Join Date

                        1)        In natural state employee will always has active personal data if they join in the future

                        2)        If a user changes the earliest Personal Data start date to a future date, creating an ""empty"" state for today, the system should use the nearest future Personal Data as a reference.

Historical Data for Personal Data
Solution

D. Migration
1)        Employee's min(Join Date, today) will serve as the effective date for the first record of their Personal Data in the current CATAPA system.

2)        Employee’s Date of Marriage will be left empty since it is an optional field and CATAPA currently does not have reliable date for it.

E. Effect on Other Modules/Features
1)        General rules:

        a)        The addition of an effective date must make the current API backward-compatible

        b)        Without entering the date parameter, the Personal Data should be able to return the current active Personal Data

2)        Potentially affected Modules:

        a)        Employee Name referenced by other modules

                i)        Past & today join date

                        1)        Since the employee always has Personal Data after the Join Date, use active Personal Data.

                ii)        Future Join Date

                        1)        In natural state employee will always has active personal data if they join in the future

                        2)        If a user changes the earliest Personal Data start date to a future date, creating an ""empty"" state for today, the system should use the nearest future Personal Data as a reference.

Panjang minimum default adalah 8 karakter, namun dapat diatur antara 8 hingga 99 karakter melalui kebijakan keamanan. Sistem dapat mewajibkan penggunaan minimal satu huruf kapital dan satu huruf kecil. Batas percobaan gagal login dapat ditentukan antara 1 hingga 10 kali; jika terlampaui, akun akan diblokir dan pengguna menerima tautan reset melalui email. Selain itu, kebijakan dapat mencegah penggunaan ulang kata sandi lama serta mengatur masa kedaluwarsa kata sandi dalam hitungan hari.","[""152567-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-478"", ""152567-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-479"", ""152567-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-482"", ""152567-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-484"", ""152567-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-485"", ""152567-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-451"", ""152567-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-452"", ""152567-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-453"", ""152567-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-459"", ""152567-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-460""]","Field:

Cluster Table","Master Data Codification

Background
To fulfill Djarum's request for integration between SAP and CATAPA, so that migration and data integration can be done more seamlessly. This codification also helps their third parties make minimum changes when integrating with CATAPA.

Problem Statement
CATAPA cannot store the code of master data from SAP into CATAPA database since there is no master data code. For further integration with another system, the master data codification is mandatory to keep the integration seamless.

Objective
1)        Add master data code for these pages:

        a)        [Identity Card](https://apps.catapa.com/dashboard/master-data/identity-card)

        b)        [House Status](https://apps.catapa.com/dashboard/master-data/house-status)

        c)        [Religion](https://apps.catapa.com/dashboard/master-data/religion)

        d)        [Race](https://apps.catapa.com/dashboard/master-data/race)

        e)        [Family relation](https://apps.catapa.com/dashboard/master-data/family-relation)

        f)        [Education level](https://apps.catapa.com/dashboard/master-data/education-level)

        g)        [Discipline](https://apps.catapa.com/dashboard/master-data/discipline)

        h)        [Field of study](https://apps.catapa.com/dashboard/master-data/field-of-study)

        i)        [Institution](https://apps.catapa.com/dashboard/master-data/institution)

        j)        [Reference](https://apps.catapa.com/dashboard/master-data/reference)

        k)        [Company list](https://apps.catapa.com/dashboard/company/company-information/company-list/)

2)        Standardize UI for master data from card into table formats

Assumptions
1)        Assuming for each master data using one table

2)        Each table has their own internal ID.

3)        Master data cannot be deleted

Current Implementation
#1 Card type

The display is still using cards which is not suitable for a lot of data

|---:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------|:-------|
|  0 | [Recommendation ✅] Add code field directly into DB for each table | Create a new field for each master data tables                                         | 1)        Easily added a new column        | 1)        Need data migration for each table        |
|    |                                                                    |                                                                                        | 2)        A new field can be added into the API directly, no require join function        | 2)        Report or modules may need to be updated to keep the query consistency        |
|    |                                                                    | Length of the `Code` will be the same as the length of `Code` in the organization code | 3)        The code can be read by human and edited in the same table        |        |
|    |                                                                    |                                                                                        | 4)        Making sure the code is unique in each tables        |        |
|    |                                                                    | For migration purpose, we will divide:                                                 |        |        |

This rule applies to all master data except for Education Level, Field of Study, and Institution. These three categories do not yet have a public API, so they do not require the auto-generate code mechanism. Their uniqueness will be maintained as follows:                                                         |

|    |                                                                                                        | 5)        Refers to point A3, the creation of master data                                                         |
|    |                                                                                                        |         a)        Using CATAPA apps will require code and name and any other mandatory field                                                         |

This thing acknowledged to be inconsistent and will be revisited again later                                                         |

The display should allow the user to sort the code, name, and other information                                                         |

Appendix & Reference
Other considerations:

1)        To keep the consistency, it is better to adjust the code and migration files using master data code, not master data name. For now, it is kept as is because we don’t want this small change impacting many modules that require more effort. For future development, only the code will be kept unique.

2)        The master data is rarely added so we didn’t make the massive upload

Notes:

1)        Perlu dipastikan juga kode yang diimplementasikan di Djarum apakah hanya bisa angka / alphanumeric / special characters

2)        Di public API code dikopi dari name, code optional

3)        Di private API, code mandatory

4)        Master data city, country, currency dibiarkan as is dengan format alphabetic, bukan alphanumeric","catapa_source_9, catapa_source_9, catapa_source_9, catapa_source_9, catapa_source_9, catapa_source_9, catapa_source_9, catapa_source_9","catapa_source_9, catapa_source_9, catapa_source_9, catapa_source_9, catapa_source_9, catapa_source_9, catapa_source_9, catapa_source_9",8,

Background
Catapa is a Human Resource (HR) information system designed to manage HR-related tasks and employee data efficiently. The system includes two applications: one for HR administrators and another for employees to manage their own data. HR administrators can configure and manage various employee-related settings through the Admin Panel Setting menu. The Setup Policy feature within the Admin Panel allows HR administrators to configure policies regarding document downloads and security.

###

Admin Panel - Setup Policy

Objective
The purpose of the Setup Policy feature is to provide HR administrators with the ability to manage and configure policies related to employee document downloads and security. This includes enabling or disabling the download of specific tax-related documents, salary payslips, and loan records, as well as configuring password protection for these documents. Additionally, the feature aims to manage permissions for employees to request loans from the Employee Self-Service (ESS) system. The feature aims to enhance security and provide flexibility in managing employee document access and loan requests.

Assumptions
1)        HR administrators have the necessary permissions to access and configure the Setup Policy feature.

2)        Employees have the necessary permissions to download documents as per the configured policies.

3)        The system will validate the format of document passwords to ensure compliance with the defined format.

Current Implementation

--        Enable Loan Request: Allows employees to request loans from the ESS system.

Validation
--        Password Format Validation: When the document password feature is enabled, the system validates the format of the password. If the format is invalid, an error is thrown. The format follows the general Code Format as in the employee NIK format.

Data Constraints
--        Boolean Fields: enableDownload1721a1, enableDownload1721vi, enableDownload1721viii, enableDocumentPassword, enableDownloadSalaryPayslip, and enableLoanRecord are boolean fields and cannot be null.

--        String Field: documentPasswordFormat must be a non-null string.

Background
Catapa is a Human Resource (HR) information system designed to manage HR-related tasks and employee data efficiently. The system includes two applications: one for HR administrators and another for employees to manage their own data. HR administrators can configure and manage various employee-related settings through the Admin Panel Setting menu. The Setup Policy feature within the Admin Panel allows HR administrators to configure policies regarding document downloads and security.

###

Admin Panel - Setup Policy

Objective
The purpose of the Setup Policy feature is to provide HR administrators with the ability to manage and configure policies related to employee document downloads and security. This includes enabling or disabling the download of specific tax-related documents, salary payslips, and loan records, as well as configuring password protection for these documents. Additionally, the feature aims to manage permissions for employees to request loans from the Employee Self-Service (ESS) system. The feature aims to enhance security and provide flexibility in managing employee document access and loan requests.

Assumptions
1)	HR administrators have the necessary permissions to access and configure the Setup Policy feature.

2)	Employees have the necessary permissions to download documents as per the configured policies.

3)	The system will validate the format of document passwords to ensure compliance with the defined format.

Current Implementation

--	id: string UUIDv4, required

--	documentPasswordFormat: string, Only filled if enableDocumentPassword is true, format limited to specific placeholders

--	enableDocumentPassword: boolean, Default true

--	enableDownload1721a1: boolean, Default true

--	enableDownload1721vi: boolean, Default true

--	enableDownload1721viii: boolean, Default true

--	enableDownloadSalaryPayslip: boolean, Default true

--	enableLoanRecord: boolean, Default true

Functionalities
--	ESS Policy Management: Allows HR administrators to configure settings related to employee access and document management.

Business Logic
--	Document Downloads: Enables employees to download specific tax-related documents (1721-A1, 1721-VI, 1721-VIII), salary payslips, and loan records.

--	Document Security: Allows setting up a password format for documents that need protection.

--	Loan Entry Permission Management: Manages the permissions for employees to request loans through the Employee Self-Service (ESS) system.

--	Enable Download Salary Payslip: Allows employees to download their salary payslip.

--	Enable Loan Record: Allows employees to download their loan record.

--	Enable Loan Request: Allows employees to request loans from the ESS system.

Validation
--	Password Format Validation: When the document password feature is enabled, the system validates the format of the password. If the format is invalid, an error is thrown. The format follows the general Code Format as in the employee NIK format.

Data Constraints
--	Boolean Fields: enableDownload1721a1, enableDownload1721vi, enableDownload1721viii, enableDocumentPassword, enableDownloadSalaryPayslip, and enableLoanRecord are boolean fields and cannot be null.

--	String Field: documentPasswordFormat must be a non-null string.

56,Apa saja langkah teknis dan validasi yang dilakukan sistem saat membatalkan data terminasi karyawan?,"Pembatalan data terminasi melibatkan penghapusan file exit interview, mengaktifkan karyawan, dan mengatur ulang tim (supervisor dan bawahan). Validasi backend memastikan keberadaan entri terminasi, mengecek eligibilitas undo, menghapus file clearance interview, serta menghapus entri terminasi dari database. Proses aktivasi karyawan mencakup pengaktifan kembali keanggotaan BPJS dan PPh21, mengubah status menjadi aktif, serta memulihkan akun pengguna. Jika supervisor tidak diterminasi, tabel tim akan diperbarui untuk memasukkan bawahan. Namun, jika supervisor sudah berhenti, sistem memberikan peringatan dan tidak melakukan penyimpaan data. Jika bawahan sudah berhenti, sistem juga akan memberikan peringatan serupa.","[""153142-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-6"", ""153142-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-7"", ""153142-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-8"", ""153142-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-9"", ""153142-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-10"", ""153142-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-11"", ""153142-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-12""]","Termination Undo: Supervisor/Subordinate Handling Enhancement

Cancel Termination Data involves

1)        Deleting associated files (exit interview files)

2)        Activating the employee

3)        Reassigning their team (reassigning supervisor and subordinate)

4)        Ensuring all related data is reverted to its original state.

Backend Validations:

1)        Ensures that the termination entry exists and is in a state that allows for undoing.

2)        Validates the eligibility for undoing the termination entry.

3)        Deletes clearance interview files and nullifies exit interview data.

4)        Activates the employee and reassigns their team. (subordinate-supervisor)

5)        Deletes the severance plan and sets the inventory return date to empty if it matches the termination date.

6)        Deletes the exit interview data and the approval task associated with the termination entry.

7)        Removes the termination entry from the database.

Activating Employee During Undo Process:

1)        Functionality:

        a)        Reactivates BPJS memberships for the employee.

        b)        Activates the employee's Pph21 membership if it was deactivated.

        c)        Sets the end date in employment status history to null.

        d)        Changes the employee's status to active.

        e)        Restores the employee's user account in the system.

2)        Steps:

        a)        Reactivate BPJS Membership: Reactivates the employee's BPJS healthcare and BPJS manpower memberships.

        b)        Reactivate PPh21 Membership: Re-activates the Pph21 membership if the termination entry was approved.

        c)        Update Employment Status History: Sets the end date in the employment status history to null, indicating the employee is active again.

        d)        Activate Employee: Changes the employee's status to active and restores their user account.

        e)        Restore User Account: If the employee had a user account, it is restored to allow access to the system.

From kak Rezan, engineer for tiket.com workday ext. -> Regarding limiting supervisor-subordinate/employee team table update via Public API
Harusnya oke sih, nanti antara

1. Tiket extension dienhance

2. No change. Jadi nanti errornya muncul di dashboard tiket extension kalau memang ternyata ada sync update manager dan tax & bpjs membership untuk terminated employee

Prefernya sih #2 supaya minimal effort

Regarding update via Public API

1)        Supervisor for terminated employee can be update via Public API

Termination Undo: Supervisor/Subordinate Handling Enhancement

Solution
1)        For the Subordinate who does not have a supervisor and vice versa, the “termination undo” will not affect the Supervisor-subordinate/employee team table (himself/other people).

2)        The last supervisor-subordinate/employee team table can be recorded in the backend as “not assigned”.

3)        For further illustration, see Truth Table

4)        For the supervisor wrongfully assigned on the terminated employees:

        a)        Cleanup all current supervisor-subordinate/employee team table

        b)        If the employee's termination is undone, use the last “log” when recovering supervisor-subordinate

5)        Special note:

        a)        Termination that has been approved before the release of this fix may not 100% follow the current logic

                i)        Ex: If a supervisor is terminated and the termination is undone, the relationship with the subordinate will not recovered

6)        Future improvement:

        a)        Limit supervisor updates via Public API

Cancel Termination Data involves

1)        Deleting associated files (exit interview files)

2)        Activating the employee

3)        Reassigning their team (reassigning supervisor and subordinate)

4)        Ensuring all related data is reverted to its original state.

Backend Validations:

1)        Ensures that the termination entry exists and is in a state that allows for undoing.

2)        Validates the eligibility for undoing the termination entry.

3)        Deletes clearance interview files and nullifies exit interview data.

4)        Activates the employee and reassigns their team. (subordinate-supervisor)

5)        Deletes the severance plan and sets the inventory return date to empty if it matches the termination date.

6)        Deletes the exit interview data and the approval task associated with the termination entry.

7)        Removes the termination entry from the database.

Activating Employee During Undo Process:

1)        Functionality:

        a)        Reactivates BPJS memberships for the employee.

        b)        Activates the employee's Pph21 membership if it was deactivated.

        c)        Sets the end date in employment status history to null.

        d)        Changes the employee's status to active.

        e)        Restores the employee's user account in the system.

2)        Steps:

        a)        Reactivate BPJS Membership: Reactivates the employee's BPJS healthcare and BPJS manpower memberships.

        b)        Reactivate PPh21 Membership: Re-activates the Pph21 membership if the termination entry was approved.

        c)        Update Employment Status History: Sets the end date in the employment status history to null, indicating the employee is active again.

From kak Rezan, engineer for tiket.com workday ext. -> Regarding limiting supervisor-subordinate/employee team table update via Public API
Harusnya oke sih, nanti antara

1. Tiket extension dienhance

2. No change. Jadi nanti errornya muncul di dashboard tiket extension kalau memang ternyata ada sync update manager dan tax & bpjs membership untuk terminated employee

Prefernya sih #2 supaya minimal effort

Regarding update via Public API

1)	Supervisor for terminated employee can be update via Public API

Termination Undo: Supervisor/Subordinate Handling Enhancement

Solution
1)        For the Subordinate who does not have a supervisor and vice versa, the “termination undo” will not affect the Supervisor-subordinate/employee team table (himself/other people).

2)        The last supervisor-subordinate/employee team table can be recorded in the backend as “not assigned”.

3)        For further illustration, see Truth Table

4)        For the supervisor wrongfully assigned on the terminated employees:

        a)        Cleanup all current supervisor-subordinate/employee team table

        b)        If the employee's termination is undone, use the last “log” when recovering supervisor-subordinate

5)        Special note:

        a)        Termination that has been approved before the release of this fix may not 100% follow the current logic

                i)        Ex: If a supervisor is terminated and the termination is undone, the relationship with the subordinate will not recovered

6)        Future improvement:

        a)        Limit supervisor updates via Public API

Pengguna dapat mengunduh format e-Bupot Bulanan/Tahunan (xslx) atau lapor langsung ke DJPOnline secara batch tanpa harus mengisi nomor urut terlebih dahulu. Setelah respons diterima, sistem memberikan informasi jika data spesifik karyawan sudah dilaporkan dan memperbarui Sequence Number sesuai DJPOnline. Bukti potong hanya dapat diunduh jika Sequence Number sudah diisi. Sistem juga dapat membedakan data bulanan/tahunan serta bukti potong manual sign vs QR code.","[""153147-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-5"", ""153147-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-6"", ""153147-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-7"", ""153147-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-8"", ""153147-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-9"", ""153147-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-10""]","CATAPA x Pajakku: e-Bupot Sync

CATAPA x Pajakku: e-Bupot Sync
Background
1)        [Peraturan Direktur Jenderal Pajak Nomor PER-2/PJ/2024 tentang Bentuk dan Tata Cara Pembuatan Bukti Pemotongan Pajak Penghasilan Pasal 21 dan/atau Pajak Penghasilan Pasal 26 Serta Bentuk, Isi, Tata Cara Pengisian, Dan Tata Cara Penyampaian Surat Pemberitahuan Masa Pajak Penghasilan Pasal 21 dan/atau Pajak Penghasilan Pasal 26](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s-76IzV4YDD2AHnYyVZrknIof8eJvNLS/view?usp=sharing)

        a)        Perubahan format bukti potong yang awalnya menggunakan manual sign menjadi QR code (digital sign) per Januari 2024.

        b)        Bukti potong yang sah berlaku adalah bukti potong dengan QR code.

        c)        Perusahaan wajib memberikan bukti potong dengan QR code kepada karyawan maksimal 1 bulan setelah pemotongan.

        d)        QR code hanya dapat di generate oleh DJPOnline melalui aplikasi e-Bupot, bersifat unik untuk setiap bukti potong.

        e)        CATAPA saat ini tidak dapat menyediakan bukti potong dengan QR code, sehingga perusahaan perlu membagikan bukti potong dengan QR code di luar sistem CATAPA.

                i)        Hal ini menyebabkan penurunan fungsi CATAPA yang awalnya dapat menyediakan bukti potong sah.

2)        User CATAPA perlu melaporkan pajak di luar sistem CATAPA melalui proses download format e-Bupot dan upload ke DJPOnline

        a)        Rentan terhadap perubahan format upload e-Bupot

        b)        Rentan terhadap keamanan dan kerahasiaan data

        c)        Rentan terhadap human error

Objective
1)        CATAPA dapat menyediakan bukti potong dengan QR code yang sah dan sesuai dengan peraturan pemerintah.

2)        Meningkatkan user experience user dengan mempermudah alur pelaporan pajak

62,"Mengapa CATAPA mengubah kebijakan format email di User Management dari hanya huruf kecil menjadi mendukung huruf besar (uppercase), dan bagaimana dampak teknisnya terhadap integrasi sistem?","Perubahan ini dipicu oleh masalah integrasi dengan Darwinbox, di mana sinkronisasi data ke CATAPA mengalami galat (error) validasi karena sistem lama CATAPA mewajibkan format all lowercase, sementara Darwinbox memiliki data email dengan karakter huruf besar. Pengguna sebelumnya menerima pesan kesalahan ""email does not match valid email format"". Berdasarkan riset, email bersifat case insensitive, sehingga huruf besar tidak mempengaruhi pengiriman pesan. Solusi yang diambil adalah mengizinkan input manual email dengan huruf besar di aplikasi serta mendukung penyimpanan email uppercase melalui sinkronisasi data Darwinbox agar pengguna tidak perlu mengubah data di sistem asal.","[""153017-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-5"", ""153017-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-6"", ""153017-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-8"", ""153017-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-9"", ""153017-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-10""]","Email Uppercase Lowercase User Management

Notes
Silakan hapus halaman ini jika dalam pembuatan Requirement

1)	Diperbolehkan untuk menambahkan section lain di luar yang sudah tertuang pada dokumen ini, jika memang dirasa perlu.

2)	Tidak menutup kemungkinan jika suatu saat section tambahan seperti yang disebutkan pada poin 1 menjadi default section yang ada pada template PRD.

Background
Ketika melakukan integrasi dengan Darwinbox, saat melakukan sync ke CATAPA, terdapat error validasi email di CATAPA, dimana pada aturan sistem CATAPA tidak diperbolehkan format email terdapat karakter uppercase. Sedangkan, data darwinbox terdapat email dengan format karakter uppercase.

Request customer agar dapat memasukkan email dengan uppercase pada halaman konfigurasi user list di user management dan saat sync data dari Darwinbox. Saat ini policy di CATAPA hanya mengizinkan menginputkan email dengan format all lowercase. Pada halaman konfigurasi user management user list di CATAPA, apabila email diketik menggunakan uppercase, akan muncul ""email does not match valid email format"".

Email Uppercase Lowercase User Management

Solution
Email memiliki sifat case insensitive [Source: [mailchimp.com]](https://mailchimp.com/resources/are-email-addresses-case-sensitive/#:~:text=The%20short%20answer%20is%20no,received%20by%20an%20email%20server.)

“If you accidentally capitalize or don’t capitalize a letter in an email address, will that affect the ability of the email to reach its destination? The short answer is no; email address syntax is not case sensitive.

Capitalization generally has no impact on whether or not an email is sent or received by an email server. It will get delivered regardless of whether or not letters are capitalized.”

Silakan hapus halaman ini jika dalam pembuatan Requirement

1)        Diperbolehkan untuk menambahkan section lain di luar yang sudah tertuang pada dokumen ini, jika memang dirasa perlu.

2)        Tidak menutup kemungkinan jika suatu saat section tambahan seperti yang disebutkan pada poin 1 menjadi default section yang ada pada template PRD.

Background
Ketika melakukan integrasi dengan Darwinbox, saat melakukan sync ke CATAPA, terdapat error validasi email di CATAPA, dimana pada aturan sistem CATAPA tidak diperbolehkan format email terdapat karakter uppercase. Sedangkan, data darwinbox terdapat email dengan format karakter uppercase.

Request customer agar dapat memasukkan email dengan uppercase pada halaman konfigurasi user list di user management dan saat sync data dari Darwinbox. Saat ini policy di CATAPA hanya mengizinkan menginputkan email dengan format all lowercase. Pada halaman konfigurasi user management user list di CATAPA, apabila email diketik menggunakan uppercase, akan muncul ""email does not match valid email format"".

63,Jelaskan rincian permasalahan pada format Excel Editable versi lama serta solusi yang dipilih berdasarkan survey tenant untuk meningkatkan efisiensi operasional HR,"Permasalahan utama format lama adalah redundansi data di mana satu karyawan muncul di banyak baris jika memiliki lebih dari satu komponen gaji editable, sehingga menyulitkan HR dalam pengisian. Berdasarkan survey, 81,8% tenant menyetujui Solusi No. 5, yaitu mengubah format menjadi satu baris per karyawan dengan banyak kolom untuk komponen gaji. Meskipun solusi ini akan menghasilkan sel kosong (""-"") jika karyawan tidak memiliki komponen tertentu, hal ini dianggap lebih efisien daripada navigasi antar tab. Sistem juga menyertakan validasi baru: batas maksimal 500 komponen gaji untuk pengunduhan, kewajiban mengisi Employee ID agar proses tidak berhenti, serta pesan kesalahan spesifik jika tipe jumlah yang diinput bukan angka atau jika komponen gaji tidak terdaftar dalam Salary Template karyawan.","[""152929-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-5"", ""152929-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-7"", ""152929-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-18"", ""152929-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-19"", ""152929-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-21"", ""152929-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-55"", ""152929-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-57"", ""152929-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-60"", ""152929-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-64"", ""152929-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-66""]","Enhance Editable Excel Format

Background
Berbagai tenant di CATAPA menggunakan komponen gaji Editable pada proses penggajiannya. Saat ini, CATAPA memiliki 2 cara untuk meng-input komponen gaji Editable ke dalam sistem, (1) Excel (2) Halaman Editable Editor. Dalam implementasi kesehariannya, tenant yang menggunakan Excel untuk meng-input atau update komponen gaji Editable akan dihadapkan data karyawan yang berulang karena komponen gaji Editable karyawan tersebut lebih dari satu.

Problem Statement
1)	Data karyawan yang redundan karena 1 karyawan yang sama dapat memiliki lebih dari satu baris dikarenakan data Editable yang dimiliki karyawan tersebut lebih dari satu.

2)	Kesulitan bagi HR untuk melakukan pengisian data editable karena satu karyawan bisa memiliki lebih dari 1 baris.

Objective
Mengubah format editable supaya lebih efisien dalam pengisiannya tanpa data karyawan yang berulang.

Current Implementation

1)	Beberapa data karyawan yang berulang (Employee ID & Name) dan muncul lebih dari 1 baris karena karyawan memiliki lebih dari 1 komponen gaji editable

	a)	Alpha: 2 baris (tax correction + dan -)

	b)	Charlie: 2 baris (overtime + dan -)

	c)	Delta: 4 baris (tax correction + dan -, overtime + dan -)

2)	Jika karyawan tidak memiliki komponen gaji Editable tertentu, maka komponen gaji Editable tersebut tidak akan muncul untuk karyawan tersebut

3)	Jika ada tambahan salary item editable pada salary template, user dapat update nilai editable tanpa harus update SK gaji, editable tetap akan terhitung

Behavior Editable with Multiple Salary Changes
1)	Jika ada perubahan salary template yang menyebabkan editable berubah

ACKed Behavior
1)	If user upload data into the wrong paygroup, then there will be an error message about wrong paygroup and all salary item’s cells will be blue-colored

2)	User MUST fill out the Employee ID to successfully add the data. This is due to the limitation of all Excel migration in CATAPA; if at the beginning of the row is EMPTY, then the system will stop executing.

3)	What is being shown at file Excel failed and Detail Statistic View failed is all the data that the users has filled out and uploaded before. For example, if they filled out an amount with `ABC` (text not numbers) then at the excel and detail statistic will show `ABC`.

4)	If users add a new editable `A02 - Editable Baru” in a new column, and there are 3 employees Uno, Dos, Tres, where Uno and Dos have this editable but Tres does not. When there’s a failed excel due to a user trying to input Tres’ editable, the cell color A02 - Editable Baru will not be grayed out but it will be blue, but the error message will still work (Refer to error list #1)

5)	If users change/update cell color on template

	a)	If what users input on the cell is correct but they change the cell color

		i)	Will be uploaded successfully, color does not impact the upload mechanism

	b)	If what users input on the cell leads to an error (i.e. String – refer to error list to check out what can leads to an error) and they change the cell color

		i)	Then after uploading, the cell color will stay the same as what users have updated before 
→ i.e. users update it from blue to gray, then the cell color will be gray although it should not be grayed out. But, the error message will be correct – `Editable amount type is incorrect, please fill in with number.`)

Background
Berbagai tenant di CATAPA menggunakan komponen gaji Editable pada proses penggajiannya. Saat ini, CATAPA memiliki 2 cara untuk meng-input komponen gaji Editable ke dalam sistem, (1) Excel (2) Halaman Editable Editor. Dalam implementasi kesehariannya, tenant yang menggunakan Excel untuk meng-input atau update komponen gaji Editable akan dihadapkan data karyawan yang berulang karena komponen gaji Editable karyawan tersebut lebih dari satu.

Problem Statement
1)        Data karyawan yang redundan karena 1 karyawan yang sama dapat memiliki lebih dari satu baris dikarenakan data Editable yang dimiliki karyawan tersebut lebih dari satu.

2)        Kesulitan bagi HR untuk melakukan pengisian data editable karena satu karyawan bisa memiliki lebih dari 1 baris.

Objective
Mengubah format editable supaya lebih efisien dalam pengisiannya tanpa data karyawan yang berulang.

Current Implementation

1)        Beberapa data karyawan yang berulang (Employee ID & Name) dan muncul lebih dari 1 baris karena karyawan memiliki lebih dari 1 komponen gaji editable

        a)        Alpha: 2 baris (tax correction + dan -)

        b)        Charlie: 2 baris (overtime + dan -)

        c)        Delta: 4 baris (tax correction + dan -, overtime + dan -)

2)        Jika karyawan tidak memiliki komponen gaji Editable tertentu, maka komponen gaji Editable tersebut tidak akan muncul untuk karyawan tersebut

3)        Jika ada tambahan salary item editable pada salary template, user dapat update nilai editable tanpa harus update SK gaji, editable tetap akan terhitung

Behavior Editable with Multiple Salary Changes
1)        Jika ada perubahan salary template yang menyebabkan editable berubah

2)        Mungkin menimbulkan request tenant untuk dibuatkan format-format baru untuk file migration lainnya

Pros:

1)        Menjadi nilai jual CATAPA dan dapat digunakan untuk seluruh tenant

2)        Tenant dapat memilih format yang mereka inginkan

4. Transpose row & column di excel

Flow:

1)        Arahkan user dengan memberikan tips cara transpose row dan column di Excel

2)        User dapat melakukan transpose column to row pada file Excelnya, lalu copy file tersebut ke file migrasi Editable CATAPA. Referensi:[ https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/transpose-function-ed039415-ed8a-4a81-93e9-4b6dfac76027](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/transpose-function-ed039415-ed8a-4a81-93e9-4b6dfac76027)

Cons:

1)        Manual proses dari sisi tenant

2)        Tidak mempermudah proses pengisian editable

Pros:

1)        Tidak ada pengembangan apapun dari tenant

5. Traditional development mengubah format migration

Format template: Satu tab excel untuk seluruh karyawan

Flow:

1)        User download template file migrasi Editable

2)        Format data: employee 1 row, editable multiple column

ACKed Behavior
1)        If user upload data into the wrong paygroup, then there will be an error message about wrong paygroup and all salary item’s cells will be blue-colored

2)        User MUST fill out the Employee ID to successfully add the data. This is due to the limitation of all Excel migration in CATAPA; if at the beginning of the row is EMPTY, then the system will stop executing.

3)        What is being shown at file Excel failed and Detail Statistic View failed is all the data that the users has filled out and uploaded before. For example, if they filled out an amount with `ABC` (text not numbers) then at the excel and detail statistic will show `ABC`.

4)        If users add a new editable `A02 - Editable Baru” in a new column, and there are 3 employees Uno, Dos, Tres, where Uno and Dos have this editable but Tres does not. When there’s a failed excel due to a user trying to input Tres’ editable, the cell color A02 - Editable Baru will not be grayed out but it will be blue, but the error message will still work (Refer to error list #1)

5)        If users change/update cell color on template

        a)        If what users input on the cell is correct but they change the cell color

                i)        Will be uploaded successfully, color does not impact the upload mechanism

        b)        If what users input on the cell leads to an error (i.e. String – refer to error list to check out what can leads to an error) and they change the cell color

                i)        Then after uploading, the cell color will stay the same as what users have updated before 
→ i.e. users update it from blue to gray, then the cell color will be gray although it should not be grayed out. But, the error message will be correct – `Editable amount type is incorrect, please fill in with number.`)

Background
Current Business Context
CATAPA HRIS currently provides a Repository feature for managing employee files within the system. The feature supports basic operations: upload, delete, and retrieve employee documents with a capacity of 50 files per employee.

1)	[BCAI] Business Driver: CORETAX Transition Impact
The Indonesian Tax Authority (DJP) has transitioned to the CORETAX system for tax document generation, creating a significant change in how organizations handle tax withholding certificates:

--	Previous State: CATAPA could generate 1721 A1 PDF certificates directly

--	Current State: Only certificates generated from CORETAX with official document numbers and digital signatures are considered valid

--	Impact: CATAPA-generated certificates are no longer legally valid

2)	Client Request: BCAI Requirements
PT. BCA Insurance (BCAI) has 724 employees and requires:

--	Employees must be able to self-download their 1721 A1 certificates through CATAPA ESS

--	BCAI will download official certificates from CORETAX and upload them to CATAPA

--	Certificates must be accessible to employees independently without HR intervention

###

Repository Enhancement
Background

3)	Djarum - Profile Photo Management
Djarum requires capability to manage employee profile photos at scale:

--	Bulk update employee profile photos (idea: can be supported via repository massive upload feature)

--	Source: Photos exported from zip in JPG format

--	File Naming Convention: [EmployeeID]-[EmployeeName].jpg (e.g., 02007182-Feri.jpg)

--	Use Case: BPJS pension confirmation process

	--	When employees approach retirement, BPJS team requests photo verification

	--	HR needs to provide current employee photos to BPJS for pension processing

	--	Photos must be recent and properly documented for compliance

--	Volume: Potential bulk updates for hundreds of employees simultaneously

4)	CATAPA Strategic Vision: Employee Documents Integration
CATAPA has a strategic vision to integrate the Employee Documents feature with the Repository feature:

--	Employee Documents: Generate documents (contracts, letters, certificates)

--	Repository: Store and manage generated documents centrally

--	Integration: Seamless document generation → storage → employee access workflow

CASE:

1)

This integration will create a unified document lifecycle management system within CATAPA.

Other Customer Requests

Below is the mapping of tenants with similar customer requests:

###

Repository Enhancement

Problem Statement
Problem 1: Inefficient Manual Upload Process
Current Pain Point:

--	Repository only supports one-file-at-a-time upload

--	BCAI needs to upload 1721 A1 certificates for 724 employees annually

--	Manual process is time-consuming (estimated 6-12 hours for 724 files)

--	High risk of human error (wrong file to wrong employee)

--	Not scalable for clients with >1,000 employees

Impact:

--	Poor user experience for HR administrators

--	Delays in employee access to critical documents (tax certificates)

--	Increased support burden on CATAPA team

--	Reduced competitiveness vs. modern HRIS solutions

Problem 2: No ESS Visibility Control
Current Pain Point:

--	No mechanism to control which repository files/groups are visible in ESS

--	All uploaded files are treated equally regardless of sensitivity

--	Cannot differentiate between:

	--	Employee-accessible documents (tax certs, payslips)

	--	Internal HR documents (disciplinary records, notes)

	--	Company-wide policies (handbooks, SOPs)

Impact:

--	Risk of exposing confidential/internal documents to employees

--	Cannot fulfill BCAI's requirement (employees see tax docs, but not internal files)

--	Limits repository usefulness (HR hesitant to upload sensitive docs)

--	Compliance risk (GDPR, Indonesian data protection)

###

Repository Enhancement

Problem 3: No Employee Self-Service Download
Current Pain Point:

--	Employees cannot download repository files from ESS

--	Must request documents from HR/Admin

--	HR must manually send files via email or print

--	No self-service capability

Impact:

--	Defeats the purpose of digitalization

--	High volume of repetitive HR support tickets

--	Poor employee experience (waiting time for documents)

--	Cannot meet BCAI's core requirement

--	HR workload increases unnecessarily

Problem 4: Lack of Document Organization
Current Pain Point:

--	No repository grouping/categorization system

--	All files stored flat without logical structure

--	Difficult to manage different document types (tax forms vs. contracts vs. policies)

--	No standard taxonomy for document organization

Impact:

--	Difficult to search and retrieve specific document types

--	Cannot apply bulk operations by category

--	Cannot set visibility rules by document type

--	Poor scalability (unmanageable with thousands of documents)

Problem 5: Missing Document Generation Integration
Current Pain Point:

--	Employee Documents feature (generates docs) is separate from Repository (stores docs)

--	No automated workflow: generate → store → notify employee

--	Manual steps required to move generated documents to storage

--	No centralized document lifecycle management

Impact:

--	Fragmented user experience (admins use multiple modules)

--	Risk of generated documents not being stored properly

--	No audit trail from generation to employee access

--	Cannot track document lifecycle (created → stored → viewed → downloaded)

Objective and Goals
Primary Objectives (Must-Have by EOY 2025)
Objective 1: Enable Bulk Document Upload

Goal: Allow HR administrators to upload bulk files simultaneously for multiple employees

Objective 2: Implement ESS Visibility Control

Goal: Provide configuration to control which repository groups/files appear in ESS

Objective 3: Enable Employee Self-Service Download

Goal: Allow employees to view and download their repository files through ESS

Objective 4: Establish Repository Grouping System

Goal: Create logical document categories for organization and bulk operations

Secondary Objectives (Optional/Future Phase)
Objective 5: Integrate Employee Documents with Repository

Goal: Seamless workflow from document generation → automatic storage → employee access

Objective 6: Trustee/Delegation Access

Goal: Allow designated users to access repository files on behalf of others

Assumptions
1)	Proposal Vision for Maximum storage per tenant:

	a)	Currently, CATAPA doesn’t have a total storage limit per tenant.

		i)	[CASE tenant abusing storage] Calculation worst case:

Calculation (Worst Case):

= 10,000 employees × 50 files × 25 MB per file

= 10,000 × 50 × 25

= 12,500,000 MB

= 12,500 GB

= 12.5 TB per tenant

		ii)	Why did this case suddenly become a concern?

			1)	Currently, users have to upload documents one by one, so the chances of this case occurring are still relatively low. However, with the introduction of the massive upload repository feature, the likelihood of users abusing storage may increase because the uploading process becomes much easier through massive upload.

###

Repository Enhancement
Assumptions

iv)	Key insight:

			1)	Cost Impact: A single tenant with 10,000 employees using maximum storage limits would increase monthly costs by nearly 1,400% or $1,738.79 USD (Rp 27.8 million).

			2)	Risk Factor: This represents approximately 93% of the total cost in the abuse scenario, despite being only 21% of total users.

			3)	Annual Impact: The abuse would cost an additional $20,865 USD (Rp 333.8 million) per year.

	b)	Current solution: limit storage by limiting the number of employees.

		i)	CATAPA currently enforces employee count limits via console configuration:

			1)	Console Setting: Each tenant has a configurable ""Max Employees"" limit

			2)	Enforcement: Tenant cannot create more employees than the limit

			3)	Example: A Tenant with limit of 1,000 cannot create the 1,001st employee

		ii)	But this solution did not really solve the potential storage abuse.

	c)	Why the Current Approach Has Potential for Abuse

		i)	No Total Storage Cap

			1)	✅ Employee count: Limited (e.g., 1,000 employees max)

			2)	✅ Files per employee: Limited (50 files max)

			3)	✅ File size: Limited (25 MB max per file)

			4)	❌ Total storage: NOT LIMITED

			5)	Result: 1,000 employees × 50 files × 25 MB = 1,250 GB (1.25 TB) possible

		ii)	Risk 2: Resource Monopolization - Heavy-usage tenants disproportionately consume infrastructure resources, creating inequality across the platform.

		iii)	Risk 3: No Upgrade Path - Legitimate tenants can't purchase additional storage

Tenant legitimately needs more storage:

- Current usage: 600 GB

- Employee count: 1,000 (can't increase without adding employees)

- No mechanism to purchase additional storage ❌

- Tenant is stuck

	d)	Proposal solution: Tenant-Level Storage Limits with Add-On Purchase

###

Repository Enhancement
Assumptions

Tenant legitimately needs more storage:

- Current usage: 600 GB

- Employee count: 1,000 (can't increase without adding employees)

- No mechanism to purchase additional storage ❌

- Tenant is stuck

	d)	Proposal solution: Tenant-Level Storage Limits with Add-On Purchase

		i)	New Console Configuration: Add storage limit settings to tenant configuration:

			1)	Base Storage: Auto-calculated as Max Employees × 500 MB

			2)	Add-On Storage: Admin can manually add purchased storage blocks

			3)	Total Limit: Base Storage + Add-On Storage

			4)	Enforcement: System blocks uploads when total limit reached

		ii)	Benefit:

			1)	✅ Prevents Abuse: Storage capped at reasonable limit

			2)	✅ Predictable Costs: CATAPA can forecast storage costs

			3)	✅ Monetization: Tenants pay for additional storage needs

			4)	✅ Flexibility: Tenants can purchase exactly what they need

			5)	To-do: propose this solution to management and discuss the pricing plan with busdev team.

		iii)	To-do:

			1)	Check the tenant's current usage of storage in the production environment

			2)	Create a requirement for “Add storage limit settings to tenant configuration”.

			3)	Create a pricing proposal for additional storage.

1)	Massive Upload Vision

	a)	Support other menus’ attachments upload via the massive upload repository feature. Scope:

		i)	Profile photo

		ii)	Personal data > attachments

		iii)	Education > attachments

		iv)	Identity card > attachments

Background
Current Business Context
CATAPA HRIS currently provides a Repository feature for managing employee files within the system. The feature supports basic operations: upload, delete, and retrieve employee documents with a capacity of 50 files per employee.

1)	[BCAI] Business Driver: CORETAX Transition Impact
The Indonesian Tax Authority (DJP) has transitioned to the CORETAX system for tax document generation, creating a significant change in how organizations handle tax withholding certificates:

--	Previous State: CATAPA could generate 1721 A1 PDF certificates directly

--	Current State: Only certificates generated from CORETAX with official document numbers and digital signatures are considered valid

--	Impact: CATAPA-generated certificates are no longer legally valid

2)	Client Request: BCAI Requirements
PT. BCA Insurance (BCAI) has 724 employees and requires:

--	Employees must be able to self-download their 1721 A1 certificates through CATAPA ESS

--	BCAI will download official certificates from CORETAX and upload them to CATAPA

--	Certificates must be accessible to employees independently without HR intervention

###

Repository Enhancement
Background

3)	Djarum - Profile Photo Management
Djarum requires capability to manage employee profile photos at scale:

--	Bulk update employee profile photos (idea: can be supported via repository massive upload feature)

--	Source: Photos exported from zip in JPG format

--	File Naming Convention: [EmployeeID]-[EmployeeName].jpg (e.g., 02007182-Feri.jpg)

--	Use Case: BPJS pension confirmation process

	--	When employees approach retirement, BPJS team requests photo verification

	--	HR needs to provide current employee photos to BPJS for pension processing

	--	Photos must be recent and properly documented for compliance

--	Volume: Potential bulk updates for hundreds of employees simultaneously

4)	CATAPA Strategic Vision: Employee Documents Integration
CATAPA has a strategic vision to integrate the Employee Documents feature with the Repository feature:

--	Employee Documents: Generate documents (contracts, letters, certificates)

--	Repository: Store and manage generated documents centrally

--	Integration: Seamless document generation → storage → employee access workflow

CASE:

1)

This integration will create a unified document lifecycle management system within CATAPA.

Other Customer Requests

Below is the mapping of tenants with similar customer requests:

###

Repository Enhancement

Problem Statement
Problem 1: Inefficient Manual Upload Process
Current Pain Point:

--	Repository only supports one-file-at-a-time upload

--	BCAI needs to upload 1721 A1 certificates for 724 employees annually

--	Manual process is time-consuming (estimated 6-12 hours for 724 files)

--	High risk of human error (wrong file to wrong employee)

--	Not scalable for clients with >1,000 employees

Impact:

--	Poor user experience for HR administrators

--	Delays in employee access to critical documents (tax certificates)

--	Increased support burden on CATAPA team

--	Reduced competitiveness vs. modern HRIS solutions

Problem 2: No ESS Visibility Control
Current Pain Point:

--	No mechanism to control which repository files/groups are visible in ESS

--	All uploaded files are treated equally regardless of sensitivity

--	Cannot differentiate between:

	--	Employee-accessible documents (tax certs, payslips)

	--	Internal HR documents (disciplinary records, notes)

	--	Company-wide policies (handbooks, SOPs)

Impact:

--	Risk of exposing confidential/internal documents to employees

--	Cannot fulfill BCAI's requirement (employees see tax docs, but not internal files)

--	Limits repository usefulness (HR hesitant to upload sensitive docs)

--	Compliance risk (GDPR, Indonesian data protection)

###

Repository Enhancement

Problem 3: No Employee Self-Service Download
Current Pain Point:

--	Employees cannot download repository files from ESS

--	Must request documents from HR/Admin

--	HR must manually send files via email or print

--	No self-service capability

Impact:

--	Defeats the purpose of digitalization

--	High volume of repetitive HR support tickets

--	Poor employee experience (waiting time for documents)

--	Cannot meet BCAI's core requirement

--	HR workload increases unnecessarily

Problem 4: Lack of Document Organization
Current Pain Point:

--	No repository grouping/categorization system

--	All files stored flat without logical structure

--	Difficult to manage different document types (tax forms vs. contracts vs. policies)

--	No standard taxonomy for document organization

Impact:

--	Difficult to search and retrieve specific document types

--	Cannot apply bulk operations by category

--	Cannot set visibility rules by document type

--	Poor scalability (unmanageable with thousands of documents)

Problem 5: Missing Document Generation Integration
Current Pain Point:

--	Employee Documents feature (generates docs) is separate from Repository (stores docs)

--	No automated workflow: generate → store → notify employee

--	Manual steps required to move generated documents to storage

--	No centralized document lifecycle management

Impact:

--	Fragmented user experience (admins use multiple modules)

--	Risk of generated documents not being stored properly

--	No audit trail from generation to employee access

--	Cannot track document lifecycle (created → stored → viewed → downloaded)

Objective and Goals

###

Repository Enhancement

Objective and Goals
Primary Objectives (Must-Have by EOY 2025)
Objective 1: Enable Bulk Document Upload

Goal: Allow HR administrators to upload bulk files simultaneously for multiple employees

Objective 2: Implement ESS Visibility Control

Goal: Provide configuration to control which repository groups/files appear in ESS

Objective 3: Enable Employee Self-Service Download

Goal: Allow employees to view and download their repository files through ESS

Objective 4: Establish Repository Grouping System

Goal: Create logical document categories for organization and bulk operations

Secondary Objectives (Optional/Future Phase)
Objective 5: Integrate Employee Documents with Repository

Goal: Seamless workflow from document generation → automatic storage → employee access

Objective 6: Trustee/Delegation Access

Goal: Allow designated users to access repository files on behalf of others

Assumptions
1)	Proposal Vision for Maximum storage per tenant:

	a)	Currently, CATAPA doesn’t have a total storage limit per tenant.

		i)	[CASE tenant abusing storage] Calculation worst case:

Calculation (Worst Case):

= 10,000 employees × 50 files × 25 MB per file

= 10,000 × 50 × 25

= 12,500,000 MB

= 12,500 GB

= 12.5 TB per tenant

		ii)	Why did this case suddenly become a concern?

			1)	Currently, users have to upload documents one by one, so the chances of this case occurring are still relatively low. However, with the introduction of the massive upload repository feature, the likelihood of users abusing storage may increase because the uploading process becomes much easier through massive upload.

Repository Enhancement
Assumptions

iv)	Key insight:

			1)	Cost Impact: A single tenant with 10,000 employees using maximum storage limits would increase monthly costs by nearly 1,400% or $1,738.79 USD (Rp 27.8 million).

			2)	Risk Factor: This represents approximately 93% of the total cost in the abuse scenario, despite being only 21% of total users.

			3)	Annual Impact: The abuse would cost an additional $20,865 USD (Rp 333.8 million) per year.

	b)	Current solution: limit storage by limiting the number of employees.

		i)	CATAPA currently enforces employee count limits via console configuration:

			1)	Console Setting: Each tenant has a configurable ""Max Employees"" limit

			2)	Enforcement: Tenant cannot create more employees than the limit

			3)	Example: A Tenant with limit of 1,000 cannot create the 1,001st employee

		ii)	But this solution did not really solve the potential storage abuse.

	c)	Why the Current Approach Has Potential for Abuse

		i)	No Total Storage Cap

			1)	✅ Employee count: Limited (e.g., 1,000 employees max)

			2)	✅ Files per employee: Limited (50 files max)

			3)	✅ File size: Limited (25 MB max per file)

			4)	❌ Total storage: NOT LIMITED

			5)	Result: 1,000 employees × 50 files × 25 MB = 1,250 GB (1.25 TB) possible

		ii)	Risk 2: Resource Monopolization - Heavy-usage tenants disproportionately consume infrastructure resources, creating inequality across the platform.

		iii)	Risk 3: No Upgrade Path - Legitimate tenants can't purchase additional storage

Tenant legitimately needs more storage:

- Current usage: 600 GB

- Employee count: 1,000 (can't increase without adding employees)

- No mechanism to purchase additional storage ❌

- Tenant is stuck

	d)	Proposal solution: Tenant-Level Storage Limits with Add-On Purchase

###

Repository Enhancement
Assumptions

Tenant legitimately needs more storage:

- Current usage: 600 GB

- Employee count: 1,000 (can't increase without adding employees)

- No mechanism to purchase additional storage ❌

- Tenant is stuck

	d)	Proposal solution: Tenant-Level Storage Limits with Add-On Purchase

		i)	New Console Configuration: Add storage limit settings to tenant configuration:

			1)	Base Storage: Auto-calculated as Max Employees × 500 MB

			2)	Add-On Storage: Admin can manually add purchased storage blocks

			3)	Total Limit: Base Storage + Add-On Storage

			4)	Enforcement: System blocks uploads when total limit reached

		ii)	Benefit:

			1)	✅ Prevents Abuse: Storage capped at reasonable limit

			2)	✅ Predictable Costs: CATAPA can forecast storage costs

			3)	✅ Monetization: Tenants pay for additional storage needs

			4)	✅ Flexibility: Tenants can purchase exactly what they need

			5)	To-do: propose this solution to management and discuss the pricing plan with busdev team.

		iii)	To-do:

			1)	Check the tenant's current usage of storage in the production environment

			2)	Create a requirement for “Add storage limit settings to tenant configuration”.

			3)	Create a pricing proposal for additional storage.

1)	Massive Upload Vision

	a)	Support other menus’ attachments upload via the massive upload repository feature. Scope:

		i)	Profile photo

		ii)	Personal data > attachments

		iii)	Education > attachments

		iv)	Identity card > attachments

Halo, Pengguna Setia CATAPA!

CATAPA akan menghadirkan *peningkatan fitur* pada *laporan penggajian* pada *08 Mei 2023*. Simak perubahan yang akan kami lakukan di sini:

*Sebelum*

Laporan Penggajian Lengkap hanya mampu:

1)	Download data 1 bulan saja

2)	Mampu download data semua karyawan

Laporan Penggajian Tahunan hanya mampu:

1)	Download data 1 tahun saja

2)	Download karyawan satu-per-satu

3)	Tiap karyawan dipisahkan dalam sheet berbeda di file Excel

*Sesudah*

Kami akan *menggabungkan Laporan Penggajian Tahunan* ke *Laporan Penggajian Lengkap*. Nantinya Laporan Penggajian Lengkap mampu:

1)	Download tidak hanya per 1 bulan, melainkan bisa memilih antara 1-12 bulan.

2)	Tetap mampu download data semua karyawan

3)	Tiap karyawan digabung dalam 1 sheet dan 1 tabel yang sama

4)	Terdapat kolom pembulatan tersendiri

5)	Terdapat baris Total & Grand Total tersendiri

Dengan demikian, Anda bisa langsung menggunakan *1 laporan saja yaitu Laporan Penggajian Lengkap*.

Problem Statement
1)	User ingin mendownload laporan untuk semua karyawan, tapi User perlu memilih satu per satu nama karyawan di Annual Payroll Report.

	a)	Sangat memakan waktu dalam penginputan nama karyawan khususnya jika sudah mencapai ratusan/ribuan.

	b)	Belum ada mekanisme untuk memilih karyawan secara bulk/dalam jumlah banyak saat download laporan.

2)	Data penggajian tahunan karyawan dipisah per sheet pada Excel yang terdownload.

	a)	Kesulitan melihat data antar karyawan karena terpisah oleh sheet satu per satu.

	b)	Kesulitan navigasi antar sheet karena Excel tidak menyediakan fungsi Search yang spesifik mencari suatu nama sheet tertentu.

Objective
Meningkatkan kapabilitas download data penggajian tahunan pada Annual Payroll Report agar mampu download data semua karyawan* beserta mengubah format tabel laporan agar lebih efisien untuk dilihat.

Current Implementation
Download Satu per Satu
Laporan Penggajian Tahunan hanya bisa didownload dengan mengetikkan satu per satu nama karyawan. Akan memakan waktu dan merepotkan User untuk memasukkan seluruh nama karyawan.

Current Implementation

*Internal Capability Benchmark
Telah dilakukan benchmark internal untuk melihat capability fitur download Laporan Penggajian Tahunan saat ini seberapa mampu melakukan download karyawan dalam jumlah besar. Benchmark menggunakan acuan:

1)	Format laporan as-is yang ada di CATAPA saat ini (memisahkan karyawan antar sheet, & memunculkan semua komponen gaji dari tiap proses payroll serta memunculkan total THP)

2)	Mengecek time & consumption untuk download employee sebanyak-banyaknya hingga limit

[17 Feb 2023]

Hasil benchmark adalah sebagai berikut:

1)	Dengan asumsi format report saat ini, direkomendasikan maksimal karyawan yang bisa di-download mencapai 1000 - 1500*. Waktu yang diperlukan untuk generate data sekitar 2-3 menit.

2)	Perlu diketahui bahwa hasil mungkin berbeda dengan format report baru nantinya.

3)	Data karyawan di atas 1500 sudah dalam kondisi memori hampir mencapai limit sehingga apabila lebih dari itu, possible terjadinya crash untuk pengguna CATAPA.

*Untuk kasus Tiket sebagai tenant yang request fitur ini, pada kondisi saat ini, jumlah karyawan Tiket masih memadai untuk di support. Akan tetapi, untuk tenant lain, tetap perlu mekanisme lanjutan apabila perlu download all employees.

Internal data:

update hasil benchmark terakhir di development setelah ngilangin RegionUtil.setBorder yang nggak perlu.

datanya dibikin manual duplicate data suatu employee diulang N kali sesuai jumlah employee.

- 1000 employee: ~30 detik

- 1500 employee: ~60 detik

- 2000 employee: ~90 detik (memory near limit)

- 3000 employee: crashed out of memory

[3 Mar 2023]

Hasil benchmark kedua dengan library SXSSF:

1)	Bisa download hingga 3000 employees, dengan kecepatan ~30 detik

2)	Penggunaan memory lebih kecil dari sebelumnya

*Internal Capability Benchmark

- 1000 employee: ~30 detik

- 1500 employee: ~60 detik

- 2000 employee: ~90 detik (memory near limit)

- 3000 employee: crashed out of memory

[3 Mar 2023]

Hasil benchmark kedua dengan library SXSSF:

1)	Bisa download hingga 3000 employees, dengan kecepatan ~30 detik

2)	Penggunaan memory lebih kecil dari sebelumnya

3)	Karena mendownload hingga 3000 employees masih possible, akan dicek limit maksimal dari SXSSF

[13 Mar 2023]

Hasil benchmark ketiga dengan library SXSSF:

1)	Bisa download hingga 20000 employees, total sekitar 260.000+ rows (include 12 bulan & total THP)

2)	Benchmark terbaru

	a)	3000 employees (limit yang dipilih) → 10 detik, size 8.1MB

	b)	20000 employees → 61 detik, size 54MB

Decision

1)	Menggunakan library SXSSF

2)	Memberikan limit 3000 employees karena jumlah user dari tenant terbanyak yang sudah Go-Live maupun yang masih ada di pipeline masih belum mencapai 3000 employees. Jika ada kebutuhan lebih, baru akan dinaikkan limitnya.

Chosen Solution
Solusi yang dipilih adalah Solusi 3, Hanya menggabungkan Annual Payroll Report ke Full Payroll Report.

Reason:

1)	Mencegah redundansi karena jika Annual Payroll Report ditambahkan capability yang sama, maka tidak ada bedanya dengan Full Payroll Report

2)	Lebih mudah maintain 1 report yang bisa banyak capability ketimbang ada 2 report & bisa membingungkan User

3)	Belum ada kebutuhan yang jelas terkait summary report sehingga tidak perlu melebarkan scope dahulu

Halo, Pengguna Setia CATAPA!

CATAPA akan menghadirkan *peningkatan fitur* pada *laporan penggajian* pada *08 Mei 2023*. Simak perubahan yang akan kami lakukan di sini:

*Sebelum*

Laporan Penggajian Lengkap hanya mampu:

1)	Download data 1 bulan saja

2)	Mampu download data semua karyawan

Laporan Penggajian Tahunan hanya mampu:

1)	Download data 1 tahun saja

2)	Download karyawan satu-per-satu

3)	Tiap karyawan dipisahkan dalam sheet berbeda di file Excel

*Sesudah*

Kami akan *menggabungkan Laporan Penggajian Tahunan* ke *Laporan Penggajian Lengkap*. Nantinya Laporan Penggajian Lengkap mampu:

1)	Download tidak hanya per 1 bulan, melainkan bisa memilih antara 1-12 bulan.

2)	Tetap mampu download data semua karyawan

3)	Tiap karyawan digabung dalam 1 sheet dan 1 tabel yang sama

4)	Terdapat kolom pembulatan tersendiri

5)	Terdapat baris Total & Grand Total tersendiri

Dengan demikian, Anda bisa langsung menggunakan *1 laporan saja yaitu Laporan Penggajian Lengkap*.

Full-Annual Payroll Report Enhancement
Revision History

Problem Statement
1)	User ingin mendownload laporan untuk semua karyawan, tapi User perlu memilih satu per satu nama karyawan di Annual Payroll Report.

	a)	Sangat memakan waktu dalam penginputan nama karyawan khususnya jika sudah mencapai ratusan/ribuan.

	b)	Belum ada mekanisme untuk memilih karyawan secara bulk/dalam jumlah banyak saat download laporan.

2)	Data penggajian tahunan karyawan dipisah per sheet pada Excel yang terdownload.

	a)	Kesulitan melihat data antar karyawan karena terpisah oleh sheet satu per satu.

	b)	Kesulitan navigasi antar sheet karena Excel tidak menyediakan fungsi Search yang spesifik mencari suatu nama sheet tertentu.

Objective
Meningkatkan kapabilitas download data penggajian tahunan pada Annual Payroll Report agar mampu download data semua karyawan* beserta mengubah format tabel laporan agar lebih efisien untuk dilihat.

Current Implementation
Download Satu per Satu
Laporan Penggajian Tahunan hanya bisa didownload dengan mengetikkan satu per satu nama karyawan. Akan memakan waktu dan merepotkan User untuk memasukkan seluruh nama karyawan.

*Internal Capability Benchmark
Telah dilakukan benchmark internal untuk melihat capability fitur download Laporan Penggajian Tahunan saat ini seberapa mampu melakukan download karyawan dalam jumlah besar. Benchmark menggunakan acuan:

1)	Format laporan as-is yang ada di CATAPA saat ini (memisahkan karyawan antar sheet, & memunculkan semua komponen gaji dari tiap proses payroll serta memunculkan total THP)

2)	Mengecek time & consumption untuk download employee sebanyak-banyaknya hingga limit

[17 Feb 2023]

Hasil benchmark adalah sebagai berikut:

1)	Dengan asumsi format report saat ini, direkomendasikan maksimal karyawan yang bisa di-download mencapai 1000 - 1500*. Waktu yang diperlukan untuk generate data sekitar 2-3 menit.

2)	Perlu diketahui bahwa hasil mungkin berbeda dengan format report baru nantinya.

3)	Data karyawan di atas 1500 sudah dalam kondisi memori hampir mencapai limit sehingga apabila lebih dari itu, possible terjadinya crash untuk pengguna CATAPA.

*Untuk kasus Tiket sebagai tenant yang request fitur ini, pada kondisi saat ini, jumlah karyawan Tiket masih memadai untuk di support. Akan tetapi, untuk tenant lain, tetap perlu mekanisme lanjutan apabila perlu download all employees.

Internal data:

update hasil benchmark terakhir di development setelah ngilangin RegionUtil.setBorder yang nggak perlu.

datanya dibikin manual duplicate data suatu employee diulang N kali sesuai jumlah employee.

- 1000 employee: ~30 detik

- 1500 employee: ~60 detik

- 2000 employee: ~90 detik (memory near limit)

- 3000 employee: crashed out of memory

[3 Mar 2023]

Hasil benchmark kedua dengan library SXSSF:

1)	Bisa download hingga 3000 employees, dengan kecepatan ~30 detik

2)	Penggunaan memory lebih kecil dari sebelumnya

[3 Mar 2023]

Hasil benchmark kedua dengan library SXSSF:

1)	Bisa download hingga 3000 employees, dengan kecepatan ~30 detik

2)	Penggunaan memory lebih kecil dari sebelumnya

3)	Karena mendownload hingga 3000 employees masih possible, akan dicek limit maksimal dari SXSSF

[13 Mar 2023]

Hasil benchmark ketiga dengan library SXSSF:

1)	Bisa download hingga 20000 employees, total sekitar 260.000+ rows (include 12 bulan & total THP)

2)	Benchmark terbaru

	a)	3000 employees (limit yang dipilih) → 10 detik, size 8.1MB

	b)	20000 employees → 61 detik, size 54MB

Decision

1)	Menggunakan library SXSSF

2)	Memberikan limit 3000 employees karena jumlah user dari tenant terbanyak yang sudah Go-Live maupun yang masih ada di pipeline masih belum mencapai 3000 employees. Jika ada kebutuhan lebih, baru akan dinaikkan limitnya.

Sistem menetapkan satu mata uang lokal (IDR) sebagai basis dasar untuk semua perhitungan kurs. Terdapat dua jenis nilai tukar: Payroll Rate untuk pembayaran akhir dan Tax Rate untuk perhitungan pajak. Berdasarkan regulasi pajak Indonesia (PPh 21), semua perhitungan pajak harus dilakukan dalam IDR; oleh karena itu, gaji dalam mata uang asing akan dikonversi ke IDR menggunakan kurs KMK mingguan sebelum dihitung pajaknya. Hasil proses gaji akan menampilkan nilai dalam mata uang asing dan ekuivalen IDR secara dual untuk transparansi. Laporan penggajian tetap dihasilkan dalam mata uang lokal untuk kepatuhan, sementara detail pembayaran akan disesuaikan dengan mata uang rekening bank karyawan.","[""153101-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-6"", ""153101-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-7"", ""153101-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-34"", ""153101-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-37"", ""153101-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-38"", ""153101-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-39"", ""153101-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-40"", ""153101-StructuredElementChunker-1800-360-4000-0-markdown-True-41""]","Multicurrency

Background

Indonesian Tax Calculation (PPH 21) from Foreign Currencies
PPH 21 is the income tax imposed on individuals in Indonesia. Employers are responsible for withholding this tax from employee salaries and remitting it to the government. Under Indonesian tax law, all calculations for PPH 21 must be conducted in IDR, regardless of the currency in which the salary is paid.

To effectively calculate PPH 21 for salaries expressed in foreign currencies, the following steps must be taken:

1)	Currency Conversion:

	--	Salaries paid in foreign currencies (e.g., USD, EUR) must first be converted into IDR using the appropriate exchange rate sourced from the Ministry of Finance (KMK). This is necessary to ensure compliance with tax regulations. The KMK provides weekly exchange rates that must be used for tax calculations.

	--	Additionally, for payroll transactions, employers may consider using the Bank Indonesia (BI) exchange rate for operational purposes, but all tax calculations should adhere strictly to the KMK rates.

2)	Applicable Tax Rates:

	--	After conversion, the salary amount in IDR is subjected to the relevant PPH 21 tax rates based on the employee's taxable income bracket.

	--	The tax rates vary depending on the individual's total annual income.

3)	Withholding Tax:

	--	The employer withholds the calculated PPH 21 from the converted salary amount before processing payroll.

	--	The withheld amount must be reported and paid to the tax authority as per regulatory requirements.

4)	Reporting:

	--	Employers must report the total salary paid, the amount withheld for PPH 21, and any foreign currency transactions in their financial records.

	--	The reporting should indicate both the original salary in the foreign currency and the converted amount in IDR.

--	Exchange Rate Management:

	--	Centralized Management: A dedicated section will be created for managing exchange rates, allowing users to input and adjust rates as needed. This section can include options to set default rates and view historical rates.

	--	Exchange Rate Type: The system will accommodate two types of exchange rates:

		--	Payroll Rate:

			--	Used for calculating the final salary payments to employees.

		--	Tax Rate:

			--	Used for calculating applicable taxes based on the defined local currency.

	--	Effective Date Logic: The effective date of the payment will determine the applicable rate:

Indonesian Tax Calculation (PPH 21) from Foreign Currencies
PPH 21 is the income tax imposed on individuals in Indonesia. Employers are responsible for withholding this tax from employee salaries and remitting it to the government. Under Indonesian tax law, all calculations for PPH 21 must be conducted in IDR, regardless of the currency in which the salary is paid.

To effectively calculate PPH 21 for salaries expressed in foreign currencies, the following steps must be taken:

1)	Currency Conversion:

	--	Salaries paid in foreign currencies (e.g., USD, EUR) must first be converted into IDR using the appropriate exchange rate sourced from the Ministry of Finance (KMK). This is necessary to ensure compliance with tax regulations. The KMK provides weekly exchange rates that must be used for tax calculations.

	--	Additionally, for payroll transactions, employers may consider using the Bank Indonesia (BI) exchange rate for operational purposes, but all tax calculations should adhere strictly to the KMK rates.

2)	Applicable Tax Rates:

	--	After conversion, the salary amount in IDR is subjected to the relevant PPH 21 tax rates based on the employee's taxable income bracket.

	--	The tax rates vary depending on the individual's total annual income.

3)	Withholding Tax:

	--	The employer withholds the calculated PPH 21 from the converted salary amount before processing payroll.

	--	The withheld amount must be reported and paid to the tax authority as per regulatory requirements.

4)	Reporting:

	--	Employers must report the total salary paid, the amount withheld for PPH 21, and any foreign currency transactions in their financial records.

	--	The reporting should indicate both the original salary in the foreign currency and the converted amount in IDR.

Kenaikan UMP ini dilakukan berdasarkan Peraturan Pemerintah (PP) Nomor 51 Tahun 2023 tentang Perubahan atas Peraturan Pemerintah Nomor 36 Tahun 2021 tentang Pengupahan. UMP yang ditetapkan menjadi acuan pengupahan minimum pada daerah tingkat I. Selain UMP, setiap daerah juga telah menentukan Upah Minimum Kota/Kabupaten (UMK) yang berlaku di daerah tingkat II.

Untuk mempermudah penggunanya, CATAPA melakukan pembaruan UMP dan UMK secara otomatis untuk setiap lokasi yang terdaftar di CATAPA.

Objective
1)	Menambahkan data master UMP dan UMK untuk setiap lokasi yang terdaftar di CATAPA untuk setiap tenant pengguna CATAPA.

## 
Background
Pemerintah provinsi di Indonesia telah menetapkan kenaikan Upah Minimum Provinsi (UMP) tahun 2024. Kenaikan UMP ini dilakukan berdasarkan Peraturan Pemerintah (PP) Nomor 51 Tahun 2023 tentang Perubahan atas Peraturan Pemerintah Nomor 36 Tahun 2021 tentang Pengupahan. UMP yang ditetapkan menjadi acuan pengupahan minimum pada daerah tingkat I. Selain UMP, setiap daerah juga telah menentukan Upah Minimum Kota/Kabupaten (UMK) yang berlaku di daerah tingkat II.

Untuk mempermudah penggunanya, CATAPA melakukan pembaruan UMP dan UMK secara otomatis untuk setiap lokasi yang terdaftar di CATAPA.

Objective
1)	Menambahkan data master UMP dan UMK untuk setiap lokasi yang terdaftar di CATAPA untuk setiap tenant pengguna CATAPA.

Solution
Menambahkan data UMP dan UMK dengan proses berikut:

69,Bagaimana mekanisme peningkatan validasi data bank dilakukan untuk mencegah false information dan apa kebijakan sistem jika ditemukan ketidaklengkapan data rekening saat pembayaran gaji?,"CATAPA meningkatkan validasi pada Massive Update untuk memastikan format data sesuai (STRING) dan memberikan pesan kesalahan yang jelas jika data gagal, alih-alih menampilkan pesan sukses padahal data tidak terupdate. Validasi kini mencakup panjang digit nomor rekening, di mana secara umum minimal 9 digit, namun khusus untuk Bank BCA wajib tepat 10 digit. Jika saat proses Salary Payment ditemukan bahwa Payment Method adalah Bank Transfer namun data Bank Account kosong, sistem akan menampilkan infobox edukasi atau validation modal.

Revision History

Background
Sebelum melakukan proses pada CATAPA, user perlu melakukan update data bank dari karyawan. Update dapat dilakukan secara individu maupun massal. Ketika melakukan update secara massal, ada beberapa pain points yang dirasakan user:

1)	[SOLVED BUG FIX, NEED MORE IMPROVEMENT] Kebingungan karena data berhasil terupload tetapi data bank karyawan tidak berubah

	a)	Hal ini terjadi karena format data pada excel yang digunakan bukan bertipe STRING (tidak ada segitiga hijau pada excel ketika dibuka). Ketika upload tampil data berhasil namun tidak ada update pada data karyawan

	b)	Sudah diperbaiki, data dapat diupload meskipun tidak bertipe STRING

	c)	Sistem sekarang dapat menerima data character dan tetap memunculkan pesan berhasil. Meskipun berhasil, data Payment Method karyawan tidak akan berubah

	d)	Perlu adanya validasi untuk memastikan format data sesuai dan agar status yang tampil sesuai

2)	User dapat melakukan pembayaran gaji menggunakan Bank Transfer meskipun Bank Account kosong

	a)	User yang sudah melakukan update Payment Method Bank Transfer bisa saja belum memasukkan informasi Bank Account

	b)	Ketika dilakukan Salary Payment, proses tetap berjalan. Namun, Payment Method karyawan berubah menjadi Cash

	c)	Behavior expected karena tidak ada informasi Bank Account. Namun, tidak ada konfirmasi ketika ingin melakukan pemrosesan. User bisa saja tidak menyadari adanya perubahan Payment Method

	d)	Perlu adanya enhancement untuk meminimalisir human error

Objective
1)	Memastikan data dapat terupdate dengan sesuai

2)	Memastikan tidak ada false information dari sistem ke user

3)	Mengurangi possible human error dari user

Tujuan utamanya adalah mengimplementasikan mekanisme identifikasi kelayakan karyawan berdasarkan klasifikasi penghasilan agar perhitungan pajak akurat . Karyawan tetap dinyatakan layak jika penghasilan tetap dan teraturnya di bulan Januari 2025 atau bulan pertama kerja di 2025 adalah ≤ Rp10 juta . Berbeda dengan karyawan tetap, kelayakan karyawan tidak tetap dievaluasi setiap bulan berdasarkan penghasilan per periode penggajian tersebut . Jika dinyatakan layak, pajak yang ditanggung pemerintah akan dianggap sebagai penghasilan tambahan sehingga meningkatkan Take Home Pay (THP) karyawan .

Background
The Indonesian government has introduced [PMK No. 10 of 2025](https://jdih.kemenkeu.go.id/dok/pmk-10-tahun-2025), allowing employees working in labor-intensive industries to have their employees' PPh 21 (income tax) covered by the government (DTP) as part of an economic stimulus package.

Eligible employees will have their income tax fully covered by the government, and companies must ensure correct tax calculations, payroll processing, and reporting to Coretax using templates BPMP, BPA1, and BP21.

CATAPA Payroll must implement a seamless, accurate, and compliant solution to handle this PPh 21 DTP requirement while ensuring minimal disruption to payroll operations.

Customer Requests
Government Regulation that needs to be implemented.

Problem Statement
Currently, CATAPA Payroll does not support the new eligibility criteria and flagging mechanism required for PPh 21 DTP in 2025. This leads to:

--	No clear way for companies to enable/disable DTP policy in payroll settings.

--	No automated way to determine which employees qualify for PPh 21 DTP based on new government regulations.

--	No method for identifying and tagging “fixed and regular income” used to validate DTP eligibility.

--	Lack of integration with Coretax reporting to reflect DTP status in tax reports.

Without these enhancements, companies will face compliance risks and manual workarounds for managing DTP eligibility.

###

Tax DTP 2025

Objective
The goal of this project is to:

✅ Allow companies to enable/disable PPh 21 DTP policy at the payroll settings level.

✅ Implement a mechanism to identify employees eligible for PPh 21 DTP based on income classification.

✅ Ensure accurate tax calculations, applying DTP only for employees who qualify.

✅ Provide proper payroll processing, salary slip updates, and undo mechanisms for changes in eligibility.

✅ Ensure correct reporting to Coretax, reflecting DTP status in the designated “Fasilitas” field.

###

Tax DTP 2025
Solution
(B) DTP Eligibility for Permanent vs. Temporary Employees

--	Add a ""PPh 21 DTP 2025 Policy"" setting in Tax Policy (toggle ON/OFF).
--	If enabled, DTP applies to all employees following the eligibility rules.
--	If disabled, standard PPh 21 deduction applies.

Tax DTP 2025
Solution

(C) Identifying Fixed & Regular Income
--	There are several approaches to identifying fixed & regular income. We will see the alternative approach below.

(D) Tax Calculation
--	During tax calculation, the system:

	--	Firstly will check if the DTP 2025 Policy is enabled or not.

	--	If enabled, the system checks the flagged salary items during tax calculation for each month to determine DTP eligibility.

	--	Permanent Employees

		--	If the total Fixed & Regular Income in January 2025 (or first employment month in 2025) is ≤ Rp10M, the employee is marked eligible for DTP.

		--	If eligible, an additional salary item for DTP is filled with value, reflecting the PPh 21 DTP amount.

	--	Temporary Employees

		--	If the total Fixed & Regular Income in each month is ≤ Rp10M, the employee is marked eligible for DTP.

		--	If eligible, an additional salary item for DTP is filled with value, reflecting the PPh 21 DTP amount.

--	The tax covered by the government will be considered additional income, including cases where the tax method includes a tax allowance. As a result, the net take-home pay (THP) will increase.

--	If the total tax paid by the government (DTP) exceeds the employee’s actual tax liability at the end of the year (December 2025), the excess amount will not be refunded to the employee. As a result, the net take-home pay (THP) will not increase.

--	If payroll for January 2025 is undone, the system re-evaluates eligibility based on the updated salary item amounts.

(E) Reporting & Compliance
--	Coretax export templates (BPMP, BPA1, BP21) must correctly reflect DTP in the ""Fasilitas"" field.

--	Salary slips must include a label stating “PPh 21 Ditanggung Pemerintah.”

Background
The Indonesian government has introduced [PMK No. 10 of 2025](https://jdih.kemenkeu.go.id/dok/pmk-10-tahun-2025), allowing employees working in labor-intensive industries to have their employees' PPh 21 (income tax) covered by the government (DTP) as part of an economic stimulus package.

Eligible employees will have their income tax fully covered by the government, and companies must ensure correct tax calculations, payroll processing, and reporting to Coretax using templates BPMP, BPA1, and BP21.

CATAPA Payroll must implement a seamless, accurate, and compliant solution to handle this PPh 21 DTP requirement while ensuring minimal disruption to payroll operations.

Customer Requests
Government Regulation that needs to be implemented.

Problem Statement
Currently, CATAPA Payroll does not support the new eligibility criteria and flagging mechanism required for PPh 21 DTP in 2025. This leads to:

--	No clear way for companies to enable/disable DTP policy in payroll settings.

--	No automated way to determine which employees qualify for PPh 21 DTP based on new government regulations.

--	No method for identifying and tagging “fixed and regular income” used to validate DTP eligibility.

--	Lack of integration with Coretax reporting to reflect DTP status in tax reports.

Without these enhancements, companies will face compliance risks and manual workarounds for managing DTP eligibility.

###

Tax DTP 2025

Objective
The goal of this project is to:

✅ Allow companies to enable/disable PPh 21 DTP policy at the payroll settings level.

✅ Implement a mechanism to identify employees eligible for PPh 21 DTP based on income classification.

✅ Ensure accurate tax calculations, applying DTP only for employees who qualify.

✅ Provide proper payroll processing, salary slip updates, and undo mechanisms for changes in eligibility.

✅ Ensure correct reporting to Coretax, reflecting DTP status in the designated “Fasilitas” field.
